Our findings can be helpful to automatically detect and warn players <B> who may become toxic and thus insulate potential victims <B> from toxic playing in advance.  Keywords : Toxic behavior · verbal violence · Tribunal · League of Legends · cyberbullying · online <B> games <I> 1 Introduction Multiplayer games <B> provide players <B> with the thrill of true competition <B>.  Players <B> prove themselves superior to other humans that exhibit dynamic behavior far beyond that of any computer controlled <B> opponent <B>.  Additionally , some multiplayer games <B> provide another wrinkle : teamwork <B>.  Now , not only is it a test of skill <B> between two individuals , but cooperation <B> , strategy <B> , and communication <B> between teammates <B> can ensure victory <B>.  Unfortunately , the presence of teammates <B> and their influence on victory <B> and defeat <B> can result in toxic behavior.  Toxic behavior , also known as cyberbullying [ 1 ] , griefing <B> [ 4 ] , or online disinhibition [ 7 ] , is bad behavior that violates social norms , inflicts misery , continues to cause harm after it occurs , and affects an entire community <B>.  The anonymity afforded by , and ubiquity of , computer - mediated - communication <B> ( CMC ) naturally leads <B> to hostility and aggressiveness [ 3,8 ].  A major obstacle <B> in understanding toxic behavior is its subjective perception.  Unlike unethical behavior like cheating <B> , toxic behavior is nebulously defined ; toxic <B> players <I> themselves sometimes fail to recognize their behavior as toxic [ 6 ].  Nevertheless , because of the very real impact <B> toxic behavior has on our daily lives , even outside of games <B> , a deeper understanding is necessary.  arXiv:1410.5185v1 [ cs.  SI ] 20 Oct 2014 2 Haewoon Kwak and Jeremy Blackburn To further our understanding , in this paper we explore the linguistic components of toxic behavior.  Using crowdsourced data from over 590 thousand “ judicial trials ” of accused toxic <B> players <I> representing over 2.1 million matches <B> of a popular match <B> - based <B> competition <B> game <B> , League of Legends1 , we perform a series of linguistic analyses to gain a deeper understanding of the role <B> communication <B> plays <B> in the expression of toxic behavior.  In our previous work [ 2 ] , we found that offensive language is the most reported reason across all the three regions.  Also , in North America , verbal abuse is the second most reported reason.  In other words , linguistic components are a prime method of expressing toxicity <B>.  From our analyses we draw several findings.  First , the volume of communication <B> is not uniform throughout the length of the match <B> , instead showing a bi - modal shape with peaks at the beginning and end of a match <B>.  By comparing the distribution of frequency of communications <B> between normal <B> players <I> and toxic <B> players <I> , we find subtle differences.  Typical <B> players <I> chat <B> relatively more at the beginning of a match <B> , which is mainly for ice breaking , morale boosting , and sharing early <B> strategic information.  In contrast , toxic <B> players <I> chat <B> less at the beginning but constantly more than typical <B> players <I> after some time <B> point <B> , i.e. phase <B> transition <I>.  Next , we find discriminative uni- and bi - grams used by typical <B>   and <I> toxic <I> players <I> , as signatures of them , examine the differences , and show that certain bi - grams can be classified based <B> on when they appear in a match <B>.  Temporal patterns of the linguistic signature of toxic <B> players <I> illustrate what kind of toxic playing happens as the match <B> progresses.  Deeper analysis of temporal analysis of words used by toxic <B> and <I> typical <I> players <I> reveals a more interesting picture.  We focus <B> on how a player <B> transitions to toxic by comparing the temporal usage of popular uni - grams between typical <B> players and <I> toxic <I> players <I>.  Our contribution is two - fold.  First , we characterize linguistic behavior of toxic <B> players and <I> compare <I> it <I> with that of typical <B> players <I> in online competition <B> games <B>.  Second , we find empirical support <B> to describe how a player <B> turns <B> to be toxic.  Our findings would be helpful to automatically detect and warn players <B> who may turn <B> to be toxic and thus save potential victims <B> of toxic playing in advance.  2 Dataset The League of Legends ( LoL ) is the most popular Multiplayer Online Battle Arena out today , and suffers from a high degree of toxic behavior.  The LoL <B> Tribunal is a crowdsourced system for determining the guilt of players <B> accused of tocix behavior.  We collected 590,311 Tribunal cases from the North America region representing a total of 2,107,522 individual matches <B>.  Each Tribunal case represents a single player <B> and includes up to 5 matches <B> in which he was accused of toxic behavior.  In LoL <B> players <I> can communicate via chat <B> , which is ostensibly used to share strategic plans and other important information during the game <B>.  However , chat <B> is also a prime vector for exhibiting toxic behavior.  Thus , although 1 http://leagueoflegends.com Linguistic Analysis of Toxic Behavior in an Online Video Game 3 0.00 0.01 0.02 0.03 0 25 50 75 100 Normalized Time PDF offender typical Fig.  1.  Change of chat <B> volume <I> during a match <B>.  a variety of information is presented to Tribunal reviewers [ 2 ] , in this paper we focus <B> exclusively on the in <B> - <I> game <I> chat <B> logs.  We extract 24,039,184 messages <B> from toxic <B> players and <I> 33,252,018 <I> messages <I> from typical <B> players <I>.  Because the teammates <B> of toxic <B> players <I> are directly impacted <B> by toxic <B> playing and <I> readily <I> express <I> aggressive reactions to a toxic <B> player <I> , we define typical <B> players <I> as the set of players <B> on the opposite <B> team <I> when none of them report <B> the toxic <B> player <I>.  Before continuing , we report <B> some basic statistics about the size of vocabulary and the length of messages <B>.  We found 1,042,940 unique tokens in toxic <B> player <I> messages <B> and 1,176,356 unique tokens in typical <B> player <I> messages <B>.  While typical <B>   players <I> send 38 % more messages <B> than toxic <B> players <I> , the messages <B> are composed of only 13 % more unique tokens.  Interestingly , we find that toxic <B> players <I> send longer messages <B> than typical <B> players <I> ; the average number of words per message <B> is 3.139 and 2.732 for toxic <B> and <I> typical <I> players <I> , respectively.  3 Chat Volume over a Match <B> We begin our analysis by exploring chat <B> volume <I> over time <B>.  A LoL <B> match <I> can be broken up into logical stages <B>.  First is the early <B> game <I> ( also known as the “ laning <B> phase ” ) , where characters <B> are low level <B> and weak <B>.  In the early <B> game <I> , players <B> expend great effort towards “ farming <B> ” computer controlled <B> minions <B> to gain experience <B> and gold <B> , with aggressive <B> plays <I> against the other team <B> usually coming as the result of an over extension or other mistake <B>.  As players <B> earn gold <B> and experience <B> , they level <B> up and become stronger , and the match <B> transitions to the mid <B> game <I>.  During the mid <B> game <I> , players <B> become more aggressive and tend to group <B> up with teammates <B> to make plays <B> on their opponents <B>.  Finally , once players <B> are reaching their maximum power <B> levels <B> , the match <B> transitions into the end <B> game <I> , where teams <B> will group <B> together and make hard <B> pushes towards taking objectives <B> and winning the match <B>.  4 Haewoon Kwak and Jeremy Blackburn While these phases are not dictated by the programming of LoL , and thus there is no hard <B> cut off point <B> for when the transitions between phases occur , we suspect that each phase has an associated pattern of communication <B>.  Thus , in Figure 1 we plot the density of chat <B> messages <B> written by toxic <B> and <I> typical <I>   players <I> as a function of the normalized time <B> during a match <B>.  The plot confirms our suspicions : communication <B> is not uniform throughout the match <B>.  Instead , we see three distinct levels <B> of communication <B> , likely corresponding to the three phases of a match <B> , with relative peaks at the beginning and end of the match <B>.  This finding can be explained with a deeper understanding of how a LoL <B>   match <I> progresses.  As mentioned above , in the early <B> game <I> players <B> are relatively weak <B> and must focus <B> on farming <B> for resources <B>.  Early <B> game <I> farming <B> occurs via players <B> choosing one of three lanes <B> to spend their time <B> in.  The lanes <B> are quite far from each other on the map ( 10 + seconds or so to travel between them ) and thus players <B> on the same team <B> tend to be relatively isolated from each other.  To take advantage <B> of this isolation , and to get an early <B> lead <B> , players <B> might roam from the lane <B> they chose to play <B> in to another lane <B>.  In turn <B> , this provides their teammate <B> in the other lane <B> with a numbers advantage <B> over opposing player <B> in the lane <B>.  Colloquially , this roaming to provide a temporary numbers advantage <B> is known as a “ gank <B>.  ” To deal with ganks <B> in the early <B> game <I> , players <B> tend to communicate via chat <B> when the opposing player <B> in their <I> lane <I> has gone missing.  As the match <B> transitions to mid <B> game <I> , teammates <B> start <B> grouping <B> up.  Since they are no longer so isolated the fear of ganks dissipates , and the need to communicate missing players <B> diminishes.  Additionally , since teammates <B> are grouped <B> together , they are seeing the same portion of the map , and there is not really that much additional information they can convey to each other.  Finally , as late <B> game <I> comes around , teams <B> must focus <B> and work together to complete objectives <B> and win the match <B>.  In practice , this might involve coming to agreement on a final “ push ” for an objective <B> , or agreeing on which lane <B> the team <B> should travel down.  Also , there are some customs in <B> e - <I> sports <I> , saying ‘ gg ( good <B>   game <I> ) ’ at the end of the game <B>.  The sharp spikes contain those messages <B> as well.  While this might explain some of the spike seen at the end of Figure 1 another , simpler explanation is that players <B> are simply communicating their ( dis)pleasure in winning or losing the match <B>.  A more interesting finding is the subtle difference in the distributions of typical <B> and <I> toxic <I> players <I>.  At the early <B> stage <B> we see more active communication <B> by normal <B> players <I>.  We suppose that it includes all the messages <B> for ice breaking or cheering ( e.g. gl ( good luck ) or hf ( have fun ) ).  However , at some point <B> after the short period , toxic <B> players <I> begin to chat <B> more than typical <B> players and <I> keep <I>   <I> such pattern until by the last stage <B>.  At the last stage <B> of the match <B> , typical <B>   players <I> again chat <B> more socially , for example , sending smile emoticons , which are :D or :) , and also saying gg , as we mentioned.  The transition point <B> , where the distribution of toxic <B> players <I> cross over that of typical <B> players <I> , is a basis of our further analysis in Section 5.  Linguistic Analysis of Toxic Behavior in an Online Video Game 5 Fig.  2.  Top 10 discriminative uni- and bi - grams 4 Discriminative Words of Toxic and Typical Players The linguistic approach to the chat <B> log characterizes toxic <B> players <I> with context.  We conduct n - gram analysis because it is intuitive and straightforward.  We filter the stopwords and then count the frequency of uni- and bi - grams from the chat <B> log involving toxic reports <B> of either verbal abuse or offensive language.  In order to find discriminative n - grams of toxic <B> players <I> we need a reference for comparison.  We conduct the same n - gram analysis from enemy <B> ’s chat <B> log when verbal abuse or offensive language is not reported <B> from the enemies <B>.  We consider it as a normal conversation among players <B> and call <B> those enemies <B> typical <B>   players <I>.  We create the top 1,000 uni- and bi - grams for toxic <B> and <I> typical <I> players <I> , respectively.  We find 867 uni- and 748 bi - grams in common.  Then we obtain 133 non - overlapped uni- and 252 bi - grams for toxic <B> and <I> typical <I> players <I> ; they appear only in either toxic or typical <B> players <I>.  We define them as discriminative uni- and bi - gram for toxic <B> and <I> typical <I> players <I> , respectively.  Figure 2 shows top 10 discriminative uni- and bi - grams of toxic <B> and <I> typical <I>   players <I>.  Top 10 discriminative uni- and bi - grams of toxic <B> players <I> are filled with bad words.  That is , Riot Games does not offer even the basic level <B> of bad word filtering , and such bad words can be used as the signatures of toxic <B> players <I> who used verbal abuse or offensive language.  We find that several discriminative bi - grams of typical <B> players <I> are about strategies <B> , while most of toxic <B> players <I> ’ bigrams are bad words.  We note that some variations of ‘ fucking ’ are discriminative uni - grams but ‘ fucking ’ itself is not.  It means that ‘ fucking ’ is often used not only by toxic <B> players <I> but also by typical <B> players <I> as well.  This shows the difficulties of filtering bad words by a simple dictionary - based <B> approach.  As the next step of the linguistic approach , we are interested in when verbal abuse occurs from a temporal perspective during a match <B>.  We divide 252 discriminative bi - grams of toxic <B> players <I> into three classes <B> , early- , mid- , and latebi - grams , based <B> on when their highest frequencies occur.  Figure 3 presents an example of three temporal classes <B> of bi - grams.  Interestingly , 209 ( 82.94 % ) out of 252 bi - grams are late - bi - gram.  The early <B> - bi - gram “ ill 6 Haewoon Kwak and Jeremy Blackburn 0.00 0.25 0.50 0.75 1.00 0.00 0.25 0.50 0.75 1.00 Normalized time <B> Scaled density ill feed fucking bot report <B> noob <I> Fig.  3.  Example of early- , mid- , and late - bi - gram feed ” is a domain specific example of toxic behavior.  In LoL , one of the ways players <B> earn gold <B> and experience <B> during a match <B> is by killing <B> players <B> on the opposite <B> team <I>.  Intentional feeding is when a player <B> deliberately allows the other team <B> to kill <B> them , thus “ feeding ” the enemies <B> with gold <B> and experience <B> , in turn <B> allowing them to become quite powerful <B>.  The mid - bi - gram “ fucking bot ” is the toxic <B> player <I> expressing his displeasure for the performance of the bottom <B> lane <I>.  The bottom <B> lane <I> is usually manned by characters <B> that have a primarily late <B> - game <I> presence <I> , and thus being behind during the mid <B> - game <I> has <I> a significant impact <B> on the remainder of the match <B>.  Most verbal abuse of toxic <B> players <I> occurs in the late stage <B> of the game <B>.  For example , “ report <B> noob <I> ” is the toxic <B> player <I> requesting that the rest of his team <B> report <B> a player <B> ( the “ noob <B> ” ) that he singled out for his ire.  We believe the most likely explanation for this is that verbal abuse is most likely a response to losing a game <B> , which is often not apparent until the late <B> - game <I>. <I> For example , consider a scenario where one player <B> on the team <B> has a bad <B> game <I> , perhaps making poor <B> decisions resulting in the enemy <B> team <I> becoming quite strong.  In the early- , and even mid <B> - game <I> phases <I> , a toxic <B> player <I> might still be able to hold his own , however , when the enemy <B> team <I> groups <B> up and makes coordinated pushes in the late <B> - game <I> , <I> their relative strength <B> will often result in quick and decisive victories <B> in teamfights <B>.  If toxic playing can be detected in <B> real - <I> time <I> , we could protect potential victims <B> from verbal violence , for example via alerts <B> or simply not delivering such messages <B>.  Temporal dynamics of bi - grams might help to create a mental model of toxic <B>   players <I>.  For instance , 10 bi - grams containing ‘ bot ’ are divided into 1 early <B> - bigram , 5 mid - bi - grams , and 4 late - bi - grams.  Through manual inspection , we confirm that the early <B> - bi - gram ( ‘ go bot ’ ) is strategic and non - aggressive , the mid - bigrams are cursing , and the late - bi - grams are blaming the result of the match <B> on the bot player(s ).  This provides us with a rough idea of how toxic <B> players <I> might behave and think over time <B> : initially they have a similar mindset as typical play- Linguistic Analysis of Toxic Behavior in an Online Video Game 7 Fig.  4.  Time <B> difference of last used time <B> of uni - gram ers , but , as the game <B> plays <B> out contrary to their desires , they grow increasingly aggressive , eventually lashing out with purely abusive <B> language <I>.  We leave more sophisticated modeling of toxic <B> players <I> ’ thought process as future work.  5 Phase Transition of Toxic Players In the previous section we recognize which words are exclusively used by toxic <B>   and <I> normal <I> players <I>.  However , some words are used by both toxic <B> players and <I>   <I> normal <I> players <B>.  For these , the emerging patterns in a temporal sense could be quite different.  If we assume that toxic <B> players <I> exhibit toxic behavior in reaction to certain events happening during the match <B> , then the linguistic behavior of such toxic <B> players <I> should be the same as typical <B> players <I> before those events happen.  To validate the above hypothesis , we conduct the following experiment which is focused <B> on finding some words that are not used after some time <B> point <B> by toxic <B> players <I> , while they are continuously used by normal <B> players <I>.  We extract the top 30 uni - gram at every normalized time <B> unit <B> ( ranging <B> from 0 to 100 ) for toxic <B> players and <I> normal <I> players <I> , respectively.  Since top 30 uni - grams are quite stable during the match <B> , we obtain unique 80 uni - gram for toxic <B> players and <I> 91 <I>   <I> uni - grams for normal <B> players <I>.  We first observe that toxic <B> players <I> have slightly smaller vocabularies than that by normal <B> players <I>.  For each of these uni - grams , we compute the normalized time <B> of last use by toxic <B> players and <I> normal <I> players <I> , respectively.  Finally , we compute the difference of the last used time <B> between toxic <B> and <I> normal <I> players <I> for the common uni - grams.  Figure 4 lists the uni - grams with a time <B> difference greater than 30.  I.e. , words in the list are used later into the match <B> by normal <B> players <I>.  Some interesting patterns are present in the results.  First , emoticons , particularly smile emoticons , are almost never used by toxic <B>   players <I>.  Second , apologies ( e.g. , ‘ sorry ’ ) are also exclusively used by normal <B> players <I>.  Third , some words for strategic team <B> maneuvers ( e.g. , ‘ come ’ , ‘ ult ’ , ‘ blue <B> ’ , ‘ ward <B> ’ ) are used by toxic <B> players <I> , but this ceases at some point <B> during the match <B>.  Fourth , some words primarily used for communicating movements <B> with partners in the same lane <B> ( e.g. ‘ back ’ , ‘ b ’ , ‘ brb ’ ( be right back ) , ‘ omw ’ ( on my way ) , ‘ k ’ 8 Haewoon Kwak and Jeremy Blackburn ( okay ) ) are also used by toxic <B> players <I> , but again , after some point <B> toxic <B> players <I> stop this form of communication <B>.  Fifth , toxic <B> players <I> stop praising ( e.g. , ‘ gj ’ ( good job ) ) their teammates <B> after some point <B> in time <B>.  All these findings reveal how toxicity <B> is born during a match <B>.  It seems to be a kind of phase <B> transition <I>.  They behave the same as normal <B> players <I> during the early <B> stage <B> of the match <B> , but at some point <B> they change their behavior.  After some point <B> , they utter neither apologies nor praise to express their feelings , and also stop strategic communication <B> with team <B> members <I>.  By combining this finding with discriminative words of toxic <B> players <I> , we see the possibility for detecting a certain point <B> that a player <B> transitions to be toxic without using detailed in <B> - <I> game <I> action logs , but just chat <B> logs.  Thus , linguistic analysis of toxic <B> players <I> shows not just how different they are and when they become different as well.  6 Conclusion and Future work In this work we have examined crowdsourced data from 590 thousand cases of accused toxic <B> players <I> in a popular match <B> - based <B> competition <B> game <B> , League of Legends.  We have performed a series of linguistic analyses to gain a deeper understanding of the role <B> communication <B> plays <B> in the expression of toxic behavior.  We have several interesting findings : a bi - modal distribution of chats <B> during a match <B> , a difference between temporal chat <B> patterns between toxic <B> and <I> typical <I>   players <I> , a list of discriminative uni- and bi - grams used by typical <B> and <I> toxic <I> players <I> as signatures of them , temporal patterns of the linguistic signature of toxic <B>   players <I> , and a possible footprint of transitions from typical behavior to toxic behavior.  Our findings would be helpful to automatically detect and warn players <B> who may turn <B> to be toxic and thus save potential victims <B> of toxic playing in advance.  Finally , we suggest several directions for future work.  First , is focusing <B> on interaction between typical <B> and <I> toxic <I> players <I>.  In this work the unit <B> of our analysis is a message <B> , but we do not delve into the flow of messages <B>.  Interaction analysis could reveal more clear <B> narratives of how a player <B> transitions to toxic behavior.  Next , is building a pre - warning system to detect toxic playing earlier <B>.  The main challenge here is to build a dictionary of words that are signs of toxic playing.  As we have seen a list of discriminative uni- and bi - grams of toxic <B> and <I> typical <I>   players <I> , some bad words are also used by typical <B> players <I> as well.  This behavior is prevalent in “ trash <B> talk <I> ” culture , and an important factor in immersing players <B> in a competitive <B> game <I> [ 5 ].  Thus , any pre - warning system must be effective in detecting toxic playing while being flexible enough to allow for trash <B> talk <I> to avoid breaking the immersive gaming experience <B>.  We believe that the signature of toxic <B> and <I> typical <I> players <I> we found is a first step for building the dictionary for a pre - warning system.

Keywords : Toxic behavior · verbal violence · Tribunal · League of Legends · cyberbullying · online games <B> 1 Introduction Multiplayer games <B> provide players <B> with the thrill <B> of true competition <B> . Players <B> prove themselves superior to other humans that exhibit dynamic behavior far beyond that of any computer controlled <B> opponent <B> . Additionally , some multiplayer games <B> provide another wrinkle : teamwork <B> . Now , not only is it a test of skill <B> between two individuals , but cooperation , strategy <B> , and communication between teammates <B> can ensure victory <B> . Unfortunately , the presence of teammates <B> and their influence <B> on victory <B> and defeat <B> can result in toxic behavior . Toxic behavior , also known as cyberbullying [ 1 ] , griefing [ 4 ] , or online disinhibition [ 7 ] , is bad behavior that violates social norms , inflicts misery , continues to cause harm after it occurs , and affects an entire community . The anonymity afforded by , and ubiquity of , computer-mediated-communication ( CMC ) naturally leads <B> to hostility and aggressiveness [ 3,8 ] . A major obstacle in understanding toxic behavior is its subjective perception . Unlike unethical behavior like cheating , toxic behavior is nebulously defined ; toxic <B> players <I> themselves sometimes fail to recognize their behavior as toxic [ 6 ] . Nevertheless , because of the very real impact toxic behavior has on our daily lives , even outside of games <B> , a deeper understanding is necessary . arXiv : 1410.5185v1 [ cs.SI ] 20 Oct 2014 2 Haewoon Kwak and Jeremy Blackburn To further our understanding , in this paper we explore the linguistic components of toxic behavior . Using crowdsourced data from over 590 thousand “ judicial trials ” of accused toxic <B> players <I> representing over 2.1 million matches <B> of a popular match-based competition <B> game <B> , League of Legends1 , we perform a series of linguistic analyses to gain a deeper understanding of the role <B> communication plays <B> in the expression of toxic behavior . In our previous work [ 2 ] , we found that offensive <B> language <I> is the most reported <B> reason across all the three regions . Also , in North America , verbal abuse is the second most reported <B> reason . In other words , linguistic components are a prime method of expressing toxicity . From our analyses we draw <B> several findings . First , the volume of communication is not uniform throughout the length of the match <B> , instead showing a bi-modal shape with peaks at the beginning <B> and end of a match <B> . By comparing the distribution of frequency of communications between normal players <B> and toxic <B> players <I> , we find subtle differences . Typical players <B> chat <B> relatively more at the beginning of a match <B> , which is mainly for ice <B> breaking , morale boosting , and sharing early strategic information . In contrast , toxic <B> players <I> chat <B> less at the beginning but constantly more than typical players <B> after some time <B> point <B> , i.e . phase transition . Next , we find discriminative uni - and bi-grams used by typical and toxic <B> players <I> , as signatures of them , examine the differences , and show that certain bi-grams can be classified based <B> on when they appear in a match <B> . Temporal patterns of the linguistic signature of toxic <B> players <I> illustrate what kind of toxic <B> playing <I> happens as the match <B> progresses . Deeper analysis of temporal analysis of words used by toxic and typical players <B> reveals a more interesting picture . We focus <B> on how a player <B> transitions to toxic by comparing the temporal usage of popular uni-grams between typical players <B> and toxic <B> players <I> . Our contribution is two-fold . First , we characterize linguistic behavior of toxic <B> players <I> and compare it with that of typical players <B> in online competition <B> games <I> . Second , we find empirical support <B> to describe how a player <B> turns to be toxic . Our findings would be helpful to automatically detect and warn players <B> who may turn to be toxic and thus save potential victims <B> of toxic <B> playing <I> in advance . 2 Dataset The League of Legends ( LoL ) is the most popular Multiplayer Online Battle <B> Arena out today , and suffers from a high degree of toxic behavior . The LoL Tribunal is a crowdsourced system for determining the guilt of players <B> accused of tocix behavior . We collected 590,311 Tribunal cases from the North America region representing a total of 2,107,522 individual matches <B> . Each Tribunal case represents a single player <B> and includes up to 5 matches <B> in which he was accused of toxic behavior . In LoL players <B> can communicate via chat <B> , which is ostensibly used to share strategic <B> plans and other important information during the game <B> . However , chat <B> is also a prime vector for exhibiting toxic behavior . Thus , although 1 http :// leagueoflegends.com Linguistic Analysis of Toxic Behavior in an Online Video Game <B> 3 0.00 0.01 0.02 0.03 0 25 50 75 100 Normalized Time <B> PDF offender typical Fig. 1. Change of chat <B> volume during a match <B> . a variety of information is presented to Tribunal reviewers [ 2 ] , in this paper we focus exclusively on the in-game chat <B> logs . We extract 24,039,184 messages <B> from toxic <B> players <I> and 33,252,018 messages <B> from typical players <B> . Because the teammates <B> of toxic <B> players <I> are directly impacted by toxic <B> playing <I> and readily express aggressive reactions to a toxic <B> player <I> , we define typical players <B> as the set of players <B> on the opposite <B> team <B> when none of them report <B> the toxic <B> player <I> . Before continuing , we report some basic statistics about the size of vocabulary and the length of messages <B> . We found 1,042,940 unique tokens in toxic <B> player <I> messages <I> and 1,176,356 unique tokens in typical player <B> messages . While typical players <B> send 38 % more messages <B> than toxic <B> players <I> , the messages <B> are composed of only 13 % more unique tokens <B> . Interestingly , we find that toxic <B> players <I> send longer messages <B> than typical players <B> ; the average number of words per message <B> is 3.139 and 2.732 for toxic and typical players <B> , respectively . 3 Chat <B> Volume over a Match <B> We begin our analysis by exploring chat <B> volume over time <B> . A LoL match <B> can be broken up into logical stages . First is the early game <B> ( also known as the “ laning phase ”) , where characters <B> are low level <B> and weak . In the early game <B> , players <B> expend great effort towards “ farming ” computer controlled <B> minions <B> to gain experience <B> and gold <B> , with aggressive plays <B> against the other team <B> usually coming as the result of an over extension or other mistake . As players <B> earn gold <B> and experience <B> , they level <B> up and become stronger , and the match <B> transitions to the mid game <B> . During the mid game <B> , players <B> become more aggressive and tend to group <B> up with teammates <B> to make plays <B> on their opponents <B> . Finally <B> , once players <B> are reaching their maximum power levels <B> , the match <B> transitions into the end game <B> , where teams <B> will group <B> together and make hard pushes towards taking objectives and winning the match <B> . 4 Haewoon Kwak and Jeremy Blackburn While these phases are not dictated by the programming of LoL , and thus there is no hard cut off point <B> for when the transitions between phases occur , we suspect that each phase has an associated pattern of communication . Thus , in Figure 1 we plot the density of chat <B> messages <B> written by toxic and typical players <B> as a function of the normalized time <B> during a match <B> . The plot confirms our suspicions : communication is not uniform throughout the match <B> . Instead , we see three distinct levels <B> of communication , likely corresponding to the three phases of a match <B> , with relative peaks at the beginning <B> and end of the match <B> . This finding can be explained with a deeper understanding of how a LoL match <B> progresses . As mentioned above , in the early game <B> players <B> are relatively weak and must focus <B> on farming for resources <B> . Early game <B> farming occurs via players <B> choosing one of three lanes <B> to spend their time <B> in . The lanes <B> are quite far from each other on the map ( 10 + seconds <B> or so to travel <B> between them ) and thus players <B> on the same team <B> tend to be relatively isolated from each other . To take advantage <B> of this isolation , and to get an early lead <B> , players <B> might roam <B> from the lane <B> they chose to play <B> in to another lane <B> . In turn , this provides their teammate <B> in the other lane <B> with a numbers advantage <B> over opposing player <B> in the lane <B> . Colloquially , this roaming <B> to provide a temporary numbers advantage <B> is known as a “ gank . ” To deal with ganks in the early game <B> , players <B> tend to communicate via chat <B> when the opposing player <B> in their lane <B> has gone missing <B> . As the match <B> transitions to mid game <B> , teammates <B> start <B> grouping <B> up . Since they are no longer so isolated the fear of ganks dissipates , and the need to communicate missing players <B> diminishes . Additionally , since teammates <B> are grouped together , they are seeing the same portion of the map , and there is not really that much additional information they can convey to each other . Finally <B> , as late game <B> comes around , teams <B> must focus <B> and work together to complete objectives and win <B> the match <B> . In practice <B> , this might involve coming <B> to agreement on a final <B> “ push <B> ” for an objective , or agreeing on which lane <B> the team <B> should travel <B> down . Also , there are some customs in e-sports , saying ‘ gg ( good game <B> ) ’ at the end of the game <B> . The sharp spikes contain those messages <B> as well . While this might explain some of the spike seen at the end of Figure 1 another , simpler explanation is that players <B> are simply communicating their ( dis ) pleasure in winning or losing <B> the match <B> . A more interesting finding is the subtle difference in the distributions of typical and toxic <B> players <I> . At the early stage we see more active communication by normal players <B> . We suppose that it includes all the messages <B> for ice breaking or cheering ( e.g. gl ( good luck <B> ) or hf ( have fun <B> )) . However , at some point <B> after the short period <B> , toxic <B> players <I> begin to chat <B> more than typical players <B> and keep such pattern until by the last stage <B> . At the last stage of the match <B> , typical players <B> again chat <B> more socially , for example , sending smile emoticons , which are : D or :) , and also saying gg , as we mentioned . The transition point <B> , where the distribution of toxic <B> players <I> cross over that of typical players <B> , is a basis of our further analysis in Section 5 . Linguistic Analysis of Toxic Behavior in an Online Video Game <B> 5 Fig. 2. Top 10 discriminative uni - and bi-grams 4 Discriminative Words of Toxic and Typical Players <B> The linguistic approach to the chat <B> log characterizes toxic <B> players <I> with context . We conduct n-gram analysis because it is intuitive and straightforward . We filter the stopwords and then count the frequency of uni - and bi-grams from the chat <B> log involving toxic reports of either verbal abuse or offensive <B> language <I> . In order to find discriminative n-grams of toxic <B> players <I> we need a reference for comparison . We conduct the same n-gram analysis from enemy <B> ’s chat <B> log when verbal abuse or offensive <B> language <I> is not reported <B> from the enemies <B> . We consider it as a normal conversation among players <B> and call <B> those enemies <B> typical players <B> . We create the top 1,000 uni - and bi-grams for toxic and typical players <B> , respectively . We find 867 uni - and 748 bi-grams in common . Then we obtain 133 non-overlapped uni - and 252 bi-grams for toxic and typical players <B> ; they appear only in either toxic or typical players <B> . We define them as discriminative uni - and bi-gram for toxic and typical players <B> , respectively . Figure 2 shows top 10 discriminative uni - and bi-grams of toxic and typical players <B> . Top 10 discriminative uni - and bi-grams of toxic <B> players <I> are filled with bad words . That is , Riot Games <B> does not offer even the basic level <B> of bad word filtering <B> , and such bad words can be used as the signatures of toxic <B> players <I> who used verbal abuse or offensive <B> language <I> . We find that several discriminative bi-grams of typical players <B> are about strategies <B> , while most of toxic players’ bigrams are bad words . We note that some variations of ‘ fucking’ are discriminative uni-grams but ‘ fucking’ itself is not . It means that ‘ fucking’ is often used not only by toxic <B> players <I> but also by typical players <B> as well . This shows the difficulties of filtering <B> bad words by a simple dictionary-based approach . As the next step of the linguistic approach , we are interested in when verbal abuse occurs from a temporal perspective during a match <B> . We divide 252 discriminative bi-grams of toxic <B> players <I> into three classes <B> , early - , mid - , and latebi-grams , based <B> on when their highest frequencies occur . Figure 3 presents an example of three temporal classes of bi-grams . Interestingly , 209 ( 82.94 %) out of 252 bi-grams are late-bi-gram . The early-bi-gram “ ill 6 Haewoon Kwak and Jeremy Blackburn 0.00 0.25 0.50 0.75 1.00 0.00 0.25 0.50 0.75 1.00 Normalized time <B> Scaled density ill feed fucking bot report <B> noob Fig. 3. Example of early - , mid - , and late-bi-gram feed ” is a domain specific example of toxic behavior . In LoL , one of the ways players <B> earn gold <B> and experience <B> during a match <B> is by killing <B> players <B> on the opposite <B> team <B> . Intentional feeding is when a player <B> deliberately allows the other team <B> to kill <B> them , thus “ feeding ” the enemies <B> with gold <B> and experience <B> , in turn allowing them to become quite powerful <B> . The mid-bi-gram “ fucking bot ” is the toxic <B> player <I> expressing his displeasure for the performance of the bottom lane <B> . The bottom lane <B> is usually manned <B> by characters <B> that have a primarily late-game presence , and thus being behind <B> during the mid-game has a significant impact on the remainder of the match <B> . Most verbal abuse of toxic <B> players <I> occurs in the late stage of the game <B> . For example , “ report <B> noob ” is the toxic <B> player <I> requesting that the rest of his team <B> report <B> a player <B> ( the “ noob ”) that he singled out for his ire . We believe the most likely explanation for this is that verbal abuse is most likely a response to losing <B> a game <B> , which is often not apparent until the late-game . For example , consider a scenario where one player <B> on the team <B> has a bad game <B> , perhaps making poor decisions resulting in the enemy <B> team <B> becoming quite strong . In the early - , and even mid-game phases , a toxic <B> player <I> might still be able to hold his own , however , when the enemy <B> team <B> groups <B> up and makes coordinated pushes <B> in the late-game , their relative strength <B> will often result in quick and decisive victories <B> in teamfights . If toxic <B> playing <I> can be detected in real-time , we could protect potential victims <B> from verbal violence , for example via alerts or simply not delivering such messages <B> . Temporal dynamics of bi-grams might help to create a mental model of toxic <B> players <I> . For instance , 10 bi-grams containing ‘ bot’ are divided into 1 early-bigram , 5 mid-bi-grams , and 4 late-bi-grams . Through manual inspection , we confirm that the early-bi-gram (‘ go bot’ ) is strategic <B> and non-aggressive , the mid-bigrams are cursing <B> , and the late-bi-grams are blaming the result of the match <B> on the bot player <B> ( s ) . This provides us with a rough idea of how toxic <B> players <I> might behave and think over time <B> : initially they have a similar mindset as typical play <B> - Linguistic Analysis of Toxic Behavior in an Online <B> Video <I> Game <I> 7 Fig. 4. Time difference of last used time <B> of uni-gram ers , but , as the game <B> plays <B> out contrary to their desires , they grow increasingly aggressive , eventually lashing out with purely abusive language . We leave more sophisticated modeling of toxic players’ thought process as future work . 5 Phase Transition of Toxic <B> Players <I> In the previous section we recognize which words are exclusively used by toxic and normal players <B> . However , some words are used by both toxic <B> players <I> and normal players <B> . For these , the emerging patterns in a temporal sense could be quite different . If we assume that toxic <B> players <I> exhibit toxic behavior in reaction to certain events happening during the match <B> , then the linguistic behavior of such toxic <B> players <I> should be the same as typical players <B> before those events <B> happen . To validate the above hypothesis , we conduct the following experiment which is focused on finding some words that are not used after some time <B> point <B> by toxic <B> players <I> , while they are continuously used by normal players <B> . We extract the top 30 uni-gram at every normalized time <B> unit <B> ( ranging from 0 to 100 ) for toxic <B> players <I> and normal players <B> , respectively . Since top 30 uni-grams are quite stable during the match <B> , we obtain unique 80 uni-gram for toxic <B> players <I> and 91 uni-grams for normal players <B> . We first observe that toxic <B> players <I> have slightly smaller vocabularies than that by normal players <B> . For each of these uni-grams , we compute the normalized time <B> of last use by toxic <B> players <I> and normal players <B> , respectively . Finally , we compute the difference of the last used time <B> between toxic and normal players <B> for the common uni-grams . Figure 4 lists the uni-grams with a time <B> difference greater than 30 . I.e. , words in the list are used later into the match <B> by normal players <B> . Some interesting patterns are present in the results . First , emoticons , particularly smile emoticons <B> , are almost never used by toxic <B> players <I> . Second , apologies ( e.g. , ‘ sorry’ ) are also exclusively used by normal players <B> . Third , some words for strategic team <B> maneuvers <I> ( e.g. , ‘ come’ , ‘ ult’ , ‘ blue’ , ‘ ward’ ) are used by toxic <B> players <I> , but this ceases at some point <B> during the match <B> . Fourth <B> , some words primarily used for communicating movements with partners <B> in the same lane <B> ( e.g. ‘ back’ , ‘ b’ , ‘ brb’ ( be right back ) , ‘ omw’ ( on my way ) , ‘ k’ 8 Haewoon Kwak and Jeremy Blackburn ( okay )) are also used by toxic <B> players <I> , but again , after some point <B> toxic <B> players <I> stop this form of communication . Fifth , toxic <B> players <I> stop praising ( e.g. , ‘ gj’ ( good job )) their teammates <B> after some point <B> in time <B> . All these findings reveal how toxicity is born during a match <B> . It seems to be a kind of phase transition . They behave the same as normal players <B> during the early stage of the match <B> , but at some point <B> they change their behavior . After some point <B> , they utter neither apologies nor praise to express their feelings , and also stop strategic <B> communication with team <B> members . By combining this finding with discriminative words of toxic <B> players <I> , we see the possibility for detecting a certain point <B> that a player <B> transitions to be toxic without using detailed in-game <B> action logs , but just chat <B> logs . Thus , linguistic analysis of toxic <B> players <I> shows not just how different they are and when they become different as well . 6 Conclusion and Future work In this work we have examined crowdsourced data from 590 thousand cases of accused toxic <B> players <I> in a popular match-based competition <B> game <B> , League of Legends . We have performed a series of linguistic analyses to gain a deeper understanding of the role <B> communication plays <B> in the expression of toxic behavior . We have several interesting findings : a bi-modal distribution of chats <B> during a match <B> , a difference between temporal chat <B> patterns between toxic and typical players <B> , a list of discriminative uni - and bi-grams used by typical and toxic <B> players <I> as signatures of them , temporal patterns of the linguistic signature of toxic <B> players <I> , and a possible footprint of transitions from typical behavior to toxic behavior . Our findings would be helpful to automatically detect and warn players <B> who may turn to be toxic and thus save potential victims <B> of toxic <B> playing <I> in advance <B> . Finally , we suggest several directions for future work . First , is focusing <B> on interaction between typical and toxic <B> players <I> . In this work the unit <B> of our analysis is a message <B> , but we do not delve into the flow of messages <B> . Interaction analysis could reveal more clear narratives of how a player <B> transitions to toxic behavior . Next , is building a pre-warning system to detect toxic <B> playing <I> earlier . The main challenge <B> here is to build a dictionary of words that are signs of toxic <B> playing <I> . As we have seen a list of discriminative uni - and bi-grams of toxic and typical players <B> , some bad words are also used by typical players <B> as well . This behavior is prevalent in “ trash talk ” culture , and an important factor in immersing players <B> in a competitive game <B> [ 5 ] . Thus , any pre-warning system must be effective in detecting toxic <B> playing <I> while being flexible enough to allow for trash talk to avoid breaking the immersive gaming experience <B> . We believe that the signature of toxic and typical players <B> we found is a first step for building the dictionary for a pre-warning system .
