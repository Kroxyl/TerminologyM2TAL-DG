Abstract—Online data provide a way to monitor how users
behave in social systems like social networks and online games,
and understand which features turn an ordinary individual into a
successful one. Here, we propose to study individual performance
and success in Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA) games.
Our purpose is to identify those behaviors and playing styles
that are characteristic of players with high skill level and that
distinguish them from other players. To this aim, we study
Defense of the ancient 2 (Dota 2), a popular MOBA game. Our
findings highlight three main aspects to be successful in the game:
(i) players need to have a warm-up period to enhance their
performance in the game; (ii) having a long in-game experience
does not necessarily translate in achieving better skills; but
rather, (iii) players that reach high skill levels differentiate from
others because of their aggressive playing strategy, which implies
to kill opponents more often than cooperating with teammates,
and trying to give an early end to the match.
I. INTRODUCTION
The increasing availability of online data provides a key
way to monitor and study how users behave in online social
systems and to understand which are the characteristics that
drive users to success, e.g., having a popular account on Twitter, being an experienced user on StackExchange (collecting
badges), or becoming an advanced player in online games. A
key research question is to understand how these behavioral
patterns and users’ performance are influenced: which are
the major characteristics that bring users to perform better
(reaching success)? Which characteristics have a bad influence
on the user behavior (performance depletion)?
Individual performance and success were previously studied in different contexts: individual impact in scientific research [1], [2], successful learning strategies in education [3],
[4], online popularity [5]–[7], sport performance [8], etc.
Recently, online platforms have attracted much attention from
our research community, as they provide a way to study new
aspects related to human behavior. This is the case for social
media like Twitter, whose data can be studied to identify the
mechanisms behind user influence and popularity [5], [9]–[11],
Q&A networks as StackExchange [7], [12], [13], in which
users acquire experience by collecting badges when fulfilling
a specific task, and online games [14]–[16], where players
increase their skills by playing individually or by working as
a part of a team. Here, we focus on Multiplayer Online Battle
Arena (MOBA), a popular game genre in which users fight
with their teammates to conquer the opponent base [17], [18].
In particular, we analyze a well-known MOBA game: Defense
of the ancient 2 (Dota 2). This type of game provides indeed
key insights on how users behave and improve their skills over
time to reach success [19]–[22].
By studying individual matches over time, we not only explore how players improve while playing consecutive matches,
but also monitor how their performance changes based on the
role they are impersonating [23]. In particular, we are interested in deepening our understanding of the way players either
enhance or worsen their skills in the game. To this aim, we
study actions of individual players in consecutive matches (i.e.
sessions) to identify how and why their performance changes.
We are indeed interested in addressing some of the following
questions: how can we identify successful players? Are high
skill levels only reached by long-time experienced players?
What are the key features defining a successful player? What
are the differences between high and low experience/skill
players?
Giving an answer to these questions could help to design
new incentives (badges, rewards) with the aim of increasing
player engagement in the game as well as providing useful
recommendations to lower performer players to encourage
them to change their attitude and achieve better results [24].
The present paper is organized as follows: in §II we describe
the data and the collection process used in the study; in §III
we introduce the methods used to perform the analysis; in
§IV we report the results of our study and compare low/high
experience players and low/high skill players to understand
which are the main characteristics of successful strategies in
the game; in §V we comment the related work and provide
a comparison with our results; finally, in §VI we draw the
conclusions of our study, and describe the main findings and
future work.
II. DATA DESCRIPTION AND COLLECTION
A. Dota 2
Dota 2 is one of the most popular Multiplayer Online
Battle Arena (MOBA) video games providing a combination
of action, strategy and role play. It is played by millions of both
professional and casual fans every day worldwide.12 A single
match involves a dynamic and fast-paced battle between two
teams of 5 players competing to collectively destroy the base

2https://www.dotabuff.com/
arXiv:1801.09783v1 [cs.SI] 29 Jan 2018
structure, i.e. the Ancient defended by the opposing team. Each
player in a match controls one of the 113 characters, i.e. heroes
available in the game. These heroes are an essential element
of the game as having different combinations of heroes in the
two opposing teams makes each match unique.
Each hero is categorized, depending on its skills, in three
separated groups, namely Strength, Agility and Intelligence,
which in this paper we refer to as hero types. Strength heroes
are strong warriors that can survive receiving more damage
than others and can withstand longer battles. Agility heroes are
known for their quick response and attack speed. Intelligence
heroes often utilize their magical powers to enhance the
attack against others and can also support their allies, e.g.,
via healing or buffing skills, in different tasks. By design, a
single hero cannot be perfect in all three dimensions, but the
interplay between different types of heroes impacts the overall
strategy and outcome of each match. On the battlefield, players
accumulate experience and gold through a variety of actions
(kill, assist, death, etc.) that can be later spent to acquire new
skills to improve one’s hero and overtake the opponents.
Players usually play several matches consecutively before
taking an extended break. On average, each match lasts for 40
minutes. According to different ways of assembling players for
a competition,3
all matches can be grouped into 8 different
types, namely Public matchmaking, Practice, Tournament,
Tutorial, Co-op with AI, Team match, Solo queue, Ranked
matchmaking, and Solo Mid 1 vs 1. In this paper, we only
focus on matches with Public or Ranked matchmaking to
ensure the presence of 10 human players in each match.
B. Data Collection and Preprocessing
We collected 3,566,804 matches spanning from July 17,
2013 to December 13, 2015 using the Dota 2 official API.4
Due to data sparsity, we perform our analysis on 3,300,146
matches played since May 2015. Each entry in our dataset
contains match meta information, including start time, duration, lobby type (Ranked matchmaking, Public matchmaking,
etc.) and winning status, and it also contains information about
each player’s performance in that match, such as number of
kills, assists, deaths, gold earned, etc.
We preprocessed the collected data and selected all those
matches for which we have access to complete information.
In particular, we discarded all the matches characterized by
one of the following cases:
• Connection errors: some matches end earlier due to
connection errors. In this case, the winning status related
to the match corresponds to a null value, and the actions
performed by the players will be only partially recorded.
• Default players: not all the players allow to make
their personal information public. In this case, a unique
identifier is assigned to all these players, thus preventing
their identification.
• Leaver status: some players quit a match at the beginning, thus leaving the two opposing team unbalanced. In
3https://dota2api.readthedocs.io/en/latest/responses.html#lobby-type
4http://dota2api.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
this case, the player’s feature fields (kills, assists, deaths,
etc) will be 0.
After this filtering, we collect all players that appear in the
selected matches, which correspond to a total of 1,805,225
players.
Finally, we compute the distribution of the number of
matches per user among the 1,805,225 selected players. The
distribution, reported in Fig. 1, shows that almost 75% of
the players participated to less than 10 matches. For our
analysis, we require that each selected player played at least
10 matches. The final number of player selected after applying
this threshold is 460,026 over the 1.8 million initial ones.

III. METHODS
With the aim of investigating how player’s performance
evolves over time, we focus on two different aspects. First of
all, we look at their performance in separated sessions: to this
aim, we first grouped together matches that are played in sequence without extended breaks. Second, we are interested in
understanding how players’ performance changes accordingly
to the type of hero they select and if there is any preference in
the hero type selection. Thus, we study player’s behaviors over
time by dividing them in game sessions and further explore
player’s performance based on the selected hero by looking at
sessions characterized by the same hero type.
A. Game Sessions
We divide our dataset in time series of matches played
by those players having more than 10 matches. The long
sequence of each player’s ordered historical matches can be
divided into short time game sessions, namely short periods
of playing behavior without an extended break. In this work,
we identify game sessions by examining the time intervals
between consecutive matches against a predefined threshold.
We indeed define a game session to be composed by several
consecutive matches with no more than a 15-minute break
between them. This threshold corresponds to the peak of the

distribution of the time breaks between all the matches in
our dataset. By dividing matches into sessions, we expect
that users’ playing behavior, e.g. adopted strategies, may be
different for matches in the same session. We report the
distribution of the number of sessions with different lengths
in Fig. 2. In the following, we will focus on the analysis
of sessions whose length is between 1 and 5 matches. This
amounts for over 90% of the total sessions.

B. Game Sessions for Hero Types
A player must select a specific hero before starting a match.
The decision is based upon compound factors: overall team
formation and role balance, as well as player’s preferences.
Although different heroes have different skill sets and abilities,
heroes of the same type often have similar strengths and
weaknesses. Thus, with the expectation that a player controlling heroes of different types in a session may have different
performance, we further identify game sessions in which a
player selected the same hero type in all matches of a single
session. We report the number of sessions divided by hero
type in Tab. I. We can observe that in general there is the
tendency to use more Intelligence heroes which have a tactic
and supporting role, followed by Agility and Strength heroes.
C. TrueSkill
Players in Dota 2 are ranked by using a Matchmaking Rating
(MMR),5 whose value characterizes the skill level of a player.
5https://dota2.gamepedia.com/Matchmaking Rating
This value is used to generate the team in each game and it
increases/decreases if a player wins/loses the game.
In the available data, we do not have access to the information related to the official MMR of each player. For this
reason, we choose to define the skill level of each player
in our dataset by computing the player TrueSkill after each
match. This computation allows us to characterize players by
different skill levels. The TrueSkill is a rating system designed
by Microsoft,6 whose aim is to rank players in online games
according to their skill level. It was developed to be used for
video game matchmaking on Xbox Live and it is based on
the popular Elo rating system, used in professional chess.7
Contrary to the Elo rating system, the TrueSkill is specifically
created for games with more than two players, like MOBA
games, as opposed to 1 vs 1 games.
This method represents a player’s skill as normal distribution, characterized by two parameters: µ, i.e. the average skill
of a player, and σ, i.e. the level of uncertainty in the player’s
skill. To compute the TrueSkill of each player we rely on the
open Python implementation of the trueskill library,8
in which
we use as starting values for each player the default values
of the library: µ = 25 and σ =
25
3
. Then, for each player,
the results of all matches they played, as well as the TrueSkill
scores of their opponents at the time of that match, are used to
determine each player’s current TrueSkill score. These scores
are finally used to group users and identify high/low skill ones.
D. Experienced players vs performers
With the aim of identifying the characteristics that make
a player successful in the game, we divide players in two
categories, i.e. high experience/skill players and low experience/skill players, according to two different metrics. In the
first case, we divide the two groups of players by taking into
account the total number of matches they played. We compute
the distribution of the number of matches for all players having
more than 10 matches and we respectively label as low and
high experience players those falling in the 5th and the 95th
percentile of the distribution.
In the second case, we divide the two groups by taking
into account their experience in terms of skill level in the
game. Thus, we select the TrueSkill of each player having
more than 10 matches, as defined in the previous section,
and we compute the TrueSkill distribution. We respectively
define, accordingly to the other group division, as low and

of the TrueSkill distribution. In the following section, we will
report the results obtained by analyzing our dataset and we
will compare the defined categorizations of players, to detect
which characteristics make a player successful.
IV. RESULTS
A. Hero type characterization
We start our analysis by characterizing the three hero types,
Intelligence, Agility, and Strength and by studying how the
players perform when using one of these heroes. We take
into account both the hero type that is used by a certain
player and the overall actions he/she performs in the match:
number of kills, number of assists, and number of deaths.
Fig. 3 shows the distribution of the number of actions in each
match, in which we computed the percentages of kills, assists
and deaths for each hero type. By comparing these ternary
plots, we can characterize the different hero types, depending
on the actions performed by players. The three distributions

indeed highlight the different roles of the hero types. The
Agility hero’s distribution is more centered than the others.
This is due to the fact that the kills performed by this hero
type are more than in the other cases. This type of hero is
indeed the one having the greatest offensive power. However,
they also need support as they suffer a higher death rate in
the first part of the game. On the contrary, the distributions
related to both Intelligence and Strength heroes are similar.
These distributions display higher number of assists and lower
number of kills than the Agility heroes. This is due to the fact
that Intelligence heroes usually have a support role, i.e., assist
the team fight and keep allies alive. However, Strength heroes
are characterized by lower death rates than Intelligence ones.
They are indeed hard to kill and often start a team fight.
B. The warm-up effect
We are now interested in understanding how players perform over time, and if the use of a certain type of hero leads
to better performance across consecutive matches. Thus, we
divide player’s histories in separate sessions, as defined in §III,
and we study sessions of different lengths: from 1 to 5. For
each session of a given length, we compute the mean and the
standard deviation of the number of kills, assists, and deaths,
divided by hero type.
The results are reported in Fig. 4, which provides a characterization of the hero type consistent with what we observed
by looking at the ternary distributions over all the matches. On
the one hand, players using Agility heroes perform a greater
number of kills and lower number of assists and deaths if
compared with the other two hero types. On the other hand,
players using Strength and Intelligence hero types are more
inclined in assisting during a team fight and sacrifice for the
teammates (shown by the greater number of deaths).
Moreover, these results show an interesting trend among the
consecutive matches in a session: a warm-up effect. During the
same session indeed, the performance of players increases and
this is particularly evident in the last match of each session.
This rise in player’s performance indicates that players warmup along the matches and increment the final number of actions
of almost 10%. Another interesting feature is that the major
increment occurs in the last match of the session. This could be
interpreted by the fact that players, after the warm-up period,
reach a satisfactory performance and thus decide to stop their
playing session, i.e., “leaving the game as winners.”
Finally, to verify the robustness of our results, we carry out
our analysis on randomized sessions, which are computed by
fixing the sessions of each player and shuffling at random the
matches in the session [7], [13]. The results on the randomized
data are shown in Fig. 5, where the characteristic warm-up
effect is not anymore present. Therefore, the flat trend across
matches in the random sessions suggests that the improvement
we observed during sessions is a significant result.

Fig. 6. Comparison between the percentage of hero types used by low/high
experience players and low/high TrueSkill (TS) players. Each category,
divided in the two groups (low/high), shows different preferences in the choice
of the hero type.
C. Experience players vs performer players
In the last part of our analysis, we aim at identifying the
strategies and features that make a player successful. For
this purpose, we study players from two different angles
by comparing experienced players with skilled players. As
introduced in §III, we divide players into four groups: first we
select low/high experienced players based on their seniority
in terms of number of matches; then we select low/high skill
players based on their TrueSkill scores, i.e. skill level.
We compare these two groups of players (experienced vs
skilled) by looking at their preferences when selecting an hero
type. We compute the percentage of hero types selected by
each player in the different categories and report in Fig. 6 the
corresponding mean and standard error. The figure shows that
the more experience a player has, the more he/she tends to
prefer Intelligence and Agility roles, and thus both supporter
and fighter heroes. However, this scenario is different when
looking at the skill level of players. Players with high skill
level play less supporter roles in proportion and prefer fighter
hero types such as Agility and Strength heroes. This result also
suggests that there is no direct correlation between successful
(high skill) players and longtime (experienced) players.
This discrepancy between experienced players and skilled
players is also reflected in their strategies and actions during
matches. In the first case, both low and high experience players
show a distribution of performed actions which is consistent
with the one of Fig. 3 computed over all the players in
the dataset. There is no evident difference in the collective
strategies of low and high experience players, thus supporting
the conclusion that playing longer does not necessarily lead
to be successful in the game.
On the contrary, the comparison between performed actions
during the matches played by low and high skill players
highlights their discrepancies and characteristic features. As
reported in Fig. 7a, low skill players are characterized by
distributions that are skewed to the left side of the ternary
plots, thus indicating that this group of players generally performs a low number of kills while prefers to assists teammates
in combat. High skill players are instead characterized by
distributions that are more centered in the ternary plots of
Intelligence and Strength heroes, while in the case of Agility
heroes the distribution tends to be skewed on the right part of
the plot (cf. Fig. 7b). These features indicate that in general
high skill players make more kills than other players, even
in the case in which their role is to support the teammates.
Moreover, when using Intelligence or Strength heroes they
sacrifice (die) themselves less than low skill players.
Finally, we investigate if the two categorizations of players
(experience/skill) provide any other insight that could help in
characterizing a successful player. We look at the total duration
of the matches played by low/high experience players and
low/high skill players, to highlight groups differences.
TABLE II
MEAN AND STANDARD ERROR OF THE MATCH DURATIONS DIVIDED BY
LOW/HIGH EXPERIENCE PLAYERS AND LOW/HIGH TRUESKILL PLAYERS.
Player group mean duration SE
Low exp. players 2,532 s ±0.34 s
High exp. players 2,507 s ±1.16 s
Low TS players 2,532 s ±0.87 s
High TS players 2,447 s ±1.05 s
We computed mean and standard error over the four groups
of players, which are reported in Tab. II. According to previous results on low/high experience players strategies, the
difference displayed in the average duration of the matches
between these two groups is marginal ('25s). On the contrary,
high skill players display a bigger difference if compared with
low skill players ('85s). In particular, players with higher
skill level play shorter matches than those with low skill
level, whose average duration is closer to the one related to
low/high experienced players. A possible explanation for this
phenomenon could rely on the more aggressive strategy that
high skill players use. They indeed tend to perform more kills
than others, even when they are interpreting support roles, and
this playing style likely causes an early end to the matches.
In conclusion, our findings delineate as successful players in
Dota 2 the more individualistic players, i.e., those that prevail
over others by killing more even when they should interpret a
support role and try to end the match as soon as possible by

V. RELATED WORK
A great amount of work has been devoted to analyze
several facets in MOBA games to identify common behavioral
patterns, their evolution as well as characteristics that bring a
team in a match to be successful and win the game.
Drachen and collaborators [19] explored how game behaviors change and affect team skill levels. They analyzed
the spatio-temporal behaviors of teams during a match. They
looked at the temporal distribution of the distances between
players in the same team and how this distribution varies
between high/low skill teams. Eggert et al. [23] were interested
in classifying player’s behaviors via machine learning. These
studies are focused on quantifying collective behaviors of
teams in Dota 2 and relate these behaviors to player’s roles
that are not the official hero types we used in our analysis.
Other techniques were developed to detect and rank the
features in a team fight that help to predict whether a team will
win a match or not [20]–[22], [25]. In these studies, authors
analyzed snapshots of a combat and described the action as a
network, to extract common patterns leading to winning the
match; the authors ranked factors that can be extrinsic to the
game itself, by studying social ties of players in a team.
We differentiate from these research directions as in the
present paper we are mainly interested in providing an individual characterizations of players through both the performed
actions and the interpreted role. Moreover, we define a player
to be successful if his/her skill level (TrueSkill) is high, while
in the existing literature the overall team level is analyzed and
defined by the collective rate of victories/losses.
VI. CONCLUSION
Online platforms, such as social networks, Q&A sites, and
online games, provide a wealth of information, whose details
can help identifying how people behave in different contexts.
In particular, they are a useful means to detect the major
characteristics that turn an ordinary user in a successful one.
Here, we analyzed multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA)
games, and in particular Dota 2, with the main purpose
of extracting the underlying characteristics that distinguish
players with a low skill level from those that in the course
of their gaming experience reached the higher skill level. We
decided to focus on one important aspect of the game: the
characters players impersonate, namely heroes. By following
the official hero categorization of Dota 2, we divided the 113
heroes of the game in three main types: Intelligence, Agility,
and Strength. These three hero types define a character on the
basis of their ability and role, from support roles (as heroes
in the Intelligence group) to fighter roles (as Agility heroes).
As a first step in our evaluation, we characterized these three
hero types by looking at the way in which they are used by
Dota 2 players. We observed that overall, Intelligence heroes
are used more than the other two types, probably because this
supporting role is seen as more central to the game dynamics,
providing more flexible heroes that can be more enticing to
play. We also showed that players use heroes according to
their ability and strength: Intelligence heroes to assist, Strength
heroes to start team fights as well as assisting teammates, and
Agility heroes to kill enemies.
One interesting result we discussed is that players need
some time to warm up and increase their performance across
matches. By inspecting players’ performance in consecutive
matches, we found that the last match in a session corresponds
to the one having higher performance in terms of number of
actions (kills, assists, deaths). The robustness of this result
is proved by randomizing the matches within sessions: the
resulting null model does not display a significant ascending/descending trend — on the contrary it remains constant
from one match to the next — corroborating our finding.
Finally, we divided players by their experience (total number of matches played) in the game and by their skill level, by
computing the so called TrueSkill. Within these two groups,
we identified low/high experience players and low/high skill
players. In-depth comparisons led to the conclusion that
playing longer and thus having higher experience does not
necessarily imply that one’s skill level will increase. This
finding is supported by the analysis of the distributions
of actions performed by players with different hero types.
Low/high experience players exhibit distributions which are
consistent with those computed over all the players in the
dataset, and thus do not show a specific playing style. On
the contrary, the investigation of low/high skill players led
to the characterization of successful play styles. Successful
players, which here correspond to those having high skill level
(i.e., high TrueSkill), are aggressive players who prefer to kill
enemies more than assisting teammates in a fight even if this is
the role they are interpreting. This behavior leads these players
to prefer the use of Agility and Strength hero types and to try
to trigger an early end in the game with power plays.
Future work will be devoted to further inspect the characteristics that make players successful. We will look for possible
differences in the playing style of high skill players between
Ranked and Public matches. This will help us understand if
being part of a team of players of different levels could be an
incentive for low skill players to perform better by learning
from high skill players. Another possible direction will be to
investigate how the TrueSkill of players evolves in time and
if the playing styles of successful players we uncovered in the
present work are constant or learned over time.
