ABSTRACT
Team composition is a central factor in determining the effectiveness of a team. In this paper, we present a large-scale study on the effect of team composition on multiple measures of team effectiveness.
We use a dataset from the largest multiplayer online battle arena
(MOBA) game, Honor of Kings, with 96 million matches involving 100 million players. We measure team effectiveness based on
team performance (whether a team is going to win), team tenacity
(whether a team is going to surrender), and team rapport (whether
a team uses abusive language). Our results confirm the importance
of team diversity and show that diversity has varying effects on
team effectiveness: although diverse teams perform well and show
tenacity in adversity, they are more likely to abuse when losing
than less diverse teams. Our study also contributes to the situation
vs. personality debate and show that abusive players tend to choose
the leading role and players do not become more abusive when
taking such roles. We further demonstrate the predictive power of
features based on team composition in prediction experiments. 1

1 INTRODUCTION
The increasing complexity and scale of tasks in modern society
require individuals to work together as a team [14, 45]. Crucial to
the effectiveness of a team are the individuals in the team, i.e., team
composition. Extensive prior research has studied team roles to
analyze team composition [6, 7, 34, 35, 41, 43]. The most influential work is Belbin’s team role framework, also known as Belbin
Team Inventory. A central hypothesis in Belbin’s framework is that
balance in team roles is associated with team performance. Belbin
[7] defines nine roles 2
, and finds that teams with certain role combinations result in poor performance, even if they are formed by
members with the sharpest mind and the most experience. However, team roles are usually implicit in real life and it is difficult to
identify such nine roles in most contexts.

prediction experiments: https:/doi.org/10.1145/3308558.3312504

See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_Role_Inventories for a quick explanation.
Figure 1: Illustration of games in Honor of Kings: 1) a matching system groups 10 players into two similarly competitive
teams; 2) players in each team choose a character to control,
which is designed to play a certain role (note that multiple
players can choose the same role); 3) two teams battle to destroy opponents’ base. See the description of roles in Table 1.
Another challenge in studying the effect of team composition on
team effectiveness arises from the definition of effectiveness. Team
performance is the most straightforward definition and has been
studied in a battery of studies [10, 14, 17, 39]. Example measures of
team performance include the impact of published papers from a
team [45], winning a sports game [4, 27], etc. However, the effectiveness of a team can also be reflected by the tenacity in face of
adversity, and the rapport between team members [9]. The effect
of team composition likely depends on the definition of team effectiveness. Therefore, it is important to understand the effect of team
composition on the effectiveness of teams in multiple measures.
To address these two challenges, we identify multiplayer online
battle arena (MOBA) as an ideal testbed and provide a large-scale
study on the effect of team compositions on multiple measures
of team effectiveness. We use a dataset from Honor of Kings, the
largest MOBA game in the world, and Fig. 1 illustrates the process
of an example game. This platform is ideal for studying the effect
of team composition for three reasons. First, there are defined roles
in the game and players choose their roles to form a team. Given
that there are five players in each team, we are able to enumerate
all possible team compositions. We also have information about
arXiv:1902.06432v1 [cs.CY] 18 Feb 2019
the characteristics of each role. Second, the popularity of Honor of
Kings leads to digital traces of hundreds of millions of players in
hundreds of millions of games. These detailed game records allow
us to explore the notion of team “effectiveness” beyond the simple
measure of team performance, winning or losing. For instance, we
study the effect of team composition on abusive language use, which
reflects the rapport in a team. This research question naturally
connects to the literature on toxic behavior in online communities
and gaming [12, 13, 29].
Finally, we have access to the past history of players for capturing
their background and experience. Historical information enables us
to investigate questions in the “situation vs. personality” debate [18,
25]: how much of our behavior is determined by fixed personality
traits or by the specific situation at hand? We will explore this
question in the context of toxic behavior in online gaming.
Organization and paper highlights. In this paper, we conduct
a large-scale study on the effect of team composition in the context of online gaming. Our dataset comes from a popular MOBA
game in China, Honor of Kings, and includes 96 million games and
100 million players in total. We provide details of the dataset and
character roles in §2.
We quantitatively study the effect of team composition on three
distinct definitions of team effectiveness: (§3) team performance —
whether a team is going to win — is directly based on the result/goal
in a game and is the most common measure in prior studies; (§4)
team tenacity — whether a team is going to surrender — indicates a
team’s resilience to adversity and is understudied in existing literature as most studies only look at individual tenacity or perseverance
[5, 21]; (§5) toxic behavior, i.e., abusive language use, reflects the
rapport in a team and is extracted from the activities during a game.
Our results on team effectiveness confirm the theory that balance
in team roles is important for effective teams. We find that diverse
teams are more likely to win. Furthermore, diverse teams are less
likely to surrender, indicating a higher level of tenacity. Note that
the likelihood to surrender does not correlate with winning rate for
commonly used team compositions. However, we observe diverging
effects on abusive language use: diverse teams are more likely to
abuse when losing, but are less likely to abuse when winning.
In addition to exploring the effect of team composition on team
effectiveness, we investigate individual-level abusive language use
to understand how teamwork influences individuals and shed light
on the “situation vs. personality” debate [18, 25]. We find that
players who choose assassins (the leading role in a team) are more
likely to abuse. We further demonstrate that the reason is that
abusive players are more likely to choose assassins, instead of the
alternative explanation that a player becomes more abusive when
playing assassins. In a similar vein, we find that experienced players
are more likely to abuse, but not when their teammates are also
experienced. A design implication is that matching players with
similarly experienced players can improve the rapport in a team.
To demonstrate the effectiveness of modeling team composition,
we formulate predictions tasks for all three measures of team effectiveness in §6. We show that features based on team compositions
can consistently outperform individual player information. In fact,
modeling single roles and two-role combinations provides most of

represent their co-occurrence in the same team. The width
of edges is proportional to the square root of frequency. The

the predictive power. Finally, we present related work in §7 and
offer our concluding thoughts in §8.
2 DATASET
Our dataset is provided by Tencent3
and comes from a multiplayer
online battle arena (MOBA) game: Honor of Kings, the most profitable game in the world4
. Similar to many other MOBA games such
as Dota2 and League of Legends, Honor of Kingsinvolves two teams
to battle with each other. Each team consists of five players and
the success of a team depends on the chemistry and collaboration
between the five team members. The main motivation of our study
is that players are expected to take certain roles when they select
characters. These roles are designed to complement each other and
“good” teams usually require particular compositions of roles. In
this paper, we aim to explore the effect of team composition on
different measures of team effectiveness.
There are multiple types of games in Honor of Kings. Ranked
games are used to estimate a player’s rank level in the game; while
the other games are for practice or for fun. Since players care much
less about unranked games than ranked games, all of our analyses
are based on ranked games. Unranked games are only used to
analyze players’ role preferences.
Dataset description. Our dataset is derived from daily logs spanning three weeks in the August of 2017. Specifically, we first randomly sample 20K games in each day of the third week, thereby
obtaining 140K games and 1.3M players participating in these games.
Among them, there are 78K ranked games. Our prediction experiments in §6 are based on these ranked games, which we refer
to as prediction games. We then retrieve all the games involving
any of these 1.3M players in the first two weeks to obtain player
information for prediction. In total, we obtain 95.6M games and
100.2M players. Among these games, there are 54.4M ranked games
on which most analyses in §3, §4, and §5 are based, as under those
analytical settings, we do not need historical information of every

warrior
Warriors have a large pool of health and
considerable damage; they often undertake
the stress from enemies in side lanes.

player in a team. There are several exceptions where we need historical statistics of every team member, so we use prediction games
in those cases and will point out in the text.
The log of each game includes its start time, end time, result
(which team wins), gaming stats recorded when the game ends, and
text messages in the chat room with abusive labels. In addition, we
have access to basic player information beyond our dataset, e.g.,
number of winning games, number of games played as MVP (Most
Valuable Player) and total number of games in the past ten ranked
games, etc. See Table 5 in §A for details.
Team roles. There are five roles in Honor of Kings: warrior ( ),
mage ( ), marksman ( ), assassin ( ), and support ( ).
A team is composed of different roles depending on each player’s
choice. Henceforth, we use five icons to represent a team composition. For instance, ( , , , , ) stands for a team
with one warrior, two mages, two assassins, and no marksman
or support. In total, there exist 126 team compositions. Table 1
presents the characteristics and frequency of each role5
. Figure 2
shows the frequency of two roles co-occurring in the same team
and Table 3 shows several role combinations with its winning rate
and frequency. We can clearly see that team compositions are not
used equally by players: single roles and pairs of roles both vary
greatly in frequency. Please refer Table 2 for detailed statistics of
our dataset.
3 TEAM COMPOSITION AND WINNING
We first investigate the effect of team composition on whether a
team wins or not, a direct measure of team performance. Although
the matching system in online gaming is designed to balance the
ability of two teams, we observe that the winning rate of most team
compositions is significantly lower than 50%, indicating that some
role combinations cannot effectively work with each other.
Although two teams are with similar “skills”, there exist winning and losing team compositions (Fig. 3a). Since we have
126 different team compositions in total, it is straightforward to estimate the winning rate of each team composition using the fraction
5The boundary between roles can sometimes be blurry, especially considering different
player tactics.

players: only relatively bad players choose certain bad team compositions. Although a matching system is designed to balance the
ability of the players in two teams, it is difficult to always make
sure that two teams exactly have the same ability. Fig. 3b shows
the distribution of the rank level gap (δ) between two teams6
. To
calculate δ, we sum up the individual rank level in a team, and
subtract the result of losing team from that of winning team. By
the effect of the matching system, the rank gaps in over 90% games
are relatively small (within ±5). These minor gaps, however, are
still associated with a significant difference in winning rate: only
28.7% games end up with the winning of the lower ranked team.
Therefore, to demonstrate the influence of team compositions on
winning rates and to exclude the ability factor, we control the rank
gap between teams in Fig. 3a: we focus on games with δ = 0 (red
plots) and δ ≤ 4 (gray plots) respectively.
To further illustrate winning and losing team compositions, we
present team compositions with the highest (lowest) winning rate
in Table 37
(controlling the rank gap δ = 0). Upon a careful examination, these losing teams do not often occur, reflected also by the
cumulative distribution curve in Fig. 3a. In total, the bottom 90 losing team compositions only take 11.1% of all teams. This suggests
that most players choose a reasonable team composition. However,
the last three rows in Table 3 show that the most common team
compositions still vary in winning rates, from 48.5% to 52.6%.
Diverse teams tend to perform well (Fig. 3c, 3d). An observation that stands out in Table 3 is that teams with the highest
winning rate consist of more role categories than teams with the
lowest winning rate. For instance, support ( ) or assassin( )
dominates the two compositions with the lowest winning rate,
while all the top winning teams have at least four roles.
We further explore this observation by examining how winning
rate changes as the number of roles in a team grows (Fig. 3c). We
find that diverse team compositions are much more likely to win.
One explanation is that these roles are designed to complement
each other and teams with too few roles have weaknesses to be
exploited. For instance, a team with no mage ( ) or marksman
( ) cannot cause sufficient damage in a game. Fig. 3d shows that
most teams are employing at least three role categories, which

7 We make similar tables as Table 3 for surrendering and abusing. See §A for reference.
is consistent with the observation in Fig. 3a that the losing team
compositions on the left are not usually used.
4 TEAM COMPOSITION AND
SURRENDERING
As nothing worth achieving is going to be easy, tenacity is an important characteristic of an effective team. In the context of Honor
of Kings, team tenacity can be reflected by not surrendering easily.
The surrendering procedure is as follows: a player can propose to
surrender and if at least four of five team members agree, the team
will surrender as a whole and lose immediately. In this section, we
examine the effect of team composition on team tenacity.
Surrender probability varies across team compositions in early
games (Fig. 4a, 4b). Similar to winning, surrender happens at the
end of a game. But surrender requires extra careful analysis because
surrender may not always reflect team tenacity in Honor of Kings
and other MOBA games. For example, when the opponents are
destroying the team base and all team members are killed, it is time
to move on and surrender is simply a sign of “game over”. This
is common in late games. Therefore, it is necessary to distinguish
surrender in different game stages.
We examine the mean and the standard deviation of surrender
probability across team compositions conditioned on game duration in Fig. 4a. We make two observations. First, the surrender
probability monotonically decreases as game duration increases,
partly because a team is only allowed to surrender starting from the
6th minute and games end in 6-8 minutes mostly because a team
surrenders. Second, the standard deviation across team compositions first increases and then decreases as game duration increases,
indicating that in late games every team surrenders with similar
probability to signal game over. Based on Fig. 4a, we define three
game stages: early games (t ≤ 11), where the surrender probability has great mean and great std; late games (t > 16), where the
surrender probability has small mean and small std; middle games
(11 < t ≤ 16), the middle part8
. Proportions of games in each stages
are shown in Table 2.
8A gaming related reason for this split is that 11-minutes marks a watershed because
the “Overlord” and “Dark Tyrant” (two important non-player characters) appear at
the 10th minute and game state can change significantly from 11 to 16 minutes when
the characters get killed.

Figure 4: Team composition and surrender probability. Fig. 4a shows the mean and standard deviation of surrender probability across team compositions conditioned on game duration. Fig. 4b shows that team compositions have varying surrender
probabilities in games that end within 11 minutes, but have similar ones in longer games. Fig. 4c shows that diverse teams are
less likely to surrender in early games (error bars represent standard errors).
Having established the three types of games, we hypothesize
that surrender in early games is the most indicative of team tenacity
and varies across team compositions, while surrender in middle
and late games is more of a formality and should not depend on
team compositions. To study that, we sort team compositions by
surrender probability in early games in Fig. 4b. According to the
same order, we show the surrender probability in middle games
and late games, as well as the cumulative distribution function of
#teams. Consistent with our hypothesis, the surrender probability
of different team compositions span a wide range from 33.6% to
84.6% in early games, but is pretty stable in middle games and late
games. The CDF of #teams presents a different shape from that in
Fig. 3a: commonly used team compositions are neither the most
tenacious nor the least tenacious. Table 6 shows the most tenacious
and the least tenacious team compositions.
Diverse teams tend to be tenacious (Fig. 4c). Role diversity
influences surrender probability in early games, especially when
the number of roles is large. It seems that diverse teams with five
roles are the most tenacious in early games. In comparison, the
influence on middle and late games is minimal.
A weak team can still be tenacious (Fig. 5). We have shown
that diverse teams tend to both perform well and show tenacity in
adversity. One concern is that these two measures are correlated
and tenacity is simply a side effect of team strength (winning).
This hypothesis suggests that winning team compositions should
be less likely to surrender. To further understand this issue, we
study the correlation between surrender probability and winning
rate for different team compositions. Fig. 5a shows that there is
indeed a negative correlation between winning rate and surrender
probability in early games. There is little correlation in middle
and late games.9 However, it seems that the correlation between
winning rate and surrender probability in early games is dominated
by a few outliers with very low winning rates. Given that we know
that these teams only take a small fraction of all games in §3, we
filter infrequent team compositions that appear less than 10,000
times and find that in the remaining team compositions (98.7% of
all teams), surrender probability is not correlated with winning rate
in all game stages (Fig. 5b), suggesting that team tenacity is almost
independent of team strength/performance.
9
In fact, there is a small significantly positive coefficient in late games, which is another
evidence that strength does not entail tenacity. 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80

5 TEAM COMPOSITION AND ABUSIVE
LANGUAGE USE
Our final measure of team effectiveness is concerned with the rapport in a team during the game. We use abusive language use to
capture the rapport. Toxic behavior in online communities and gaming has received significant interests from our research community
recently [12, 13, 29]. Here we provide the first systematic study on
the effect of team composition on team-level abusive language use.
5.1 Team-level Abusive Language Use
Team compositions vary in abusing probability (Fig. 6a). In
our dataset, we have a label of whether a message uses abusive
language for all text messages based on a dictionary-based method
officially used by Tencent.10 A team abuses if any player in that team
abuses. For each team composition, we define abusing probability
as the fraction of games that this team composition abuses.
We find that similar to winning and surrendering, team compositions vary in abusing probability, ranging from 28.7% to 56.2%.
The cumulative distribution function of #teams looks much more
similar to surrendering in Fig. 4b than winning in Fig. 3a: most

and lowest abusing probability. It is striking that all the top teams
have multiple assassins ( ) and all the bottom teams have multiple supports ( ). We will investigate further the interaction of
individual-level abusing and team-level abusing in §5.2.
Losing teams are more likely to abuse (Fig. 6b). We hypothesize that losing teams are more likely to abuse because winning
usually brings positive team morale, while losing leads to frustration and dissatisfaction [29]. This is indeed the case as shown in
Fig. 6b. Therefore, it is important to distinguish abusing probability
between winning teams and losing teams.
Diverse teams tend to abuse more when losing and abuse
less when winning (Fig. 6c). We further explore the effect of
role diversity on team-level abusing. We observe different trends in
winning teams and losing teams. When a team wins, team diversity
is associated with low abusing probability; but it becomes the other
way around if a team loses.
5.2 Individual-level Abusive Language Use
Different from winning and surrendering, abusive language use
is an individual behavior. It provides a great opportunity to understand the effect of team composition on individual behavior
and shed light on the “situation vs. personality” debate [18, 25].
Note that we conduct this part of experiments on players who have
played at least 20 games to ensure sufficient samples for statistics.
A team does not equal the sum of individuals (Fig. 7a). We
define individual abusing probability based on the fraction of games
that a player abuses in.11 Because of linearity of expectation, the
total number of expected abusing players in a team is simply the
sum of each player’s abusing probability:
E(#abusing players in a team) =
Õ
v ∈team
Pabuse(v) (1)
where Pabuse is estimated separately when a player wins or loses
because abusing is associated with losing. This expectation is only
valid if all players act independently in a team, but studies on teamwork have shown that a team does not equal the sum of individuals
11All individual abusing probability is based on individual level samples. Individual
samples can be grouped based on criteria other than all games played by a single
player, e.g., we compute individual abusing probability for all winning (losing) games
of a player in Fig. 7a and for all players who choose a particular role in Fig. 7b.
[7]. Therefore, we examine the discrepancy between observed values and expected values to understand how team composition influences individual players. This analysis is done on prediction games
since it requires historical information of every team member.
Figure 7a shows the difference between observed and expected
values for winning and losing teams, where win/lose diff. refers to
the disparity between observed and expected number of abusing
players(O(#abusing players)−E(#abusing players)). For most team
compositions, the difference between observed values and expected
values is not zero, indicating that individuals abuse differently depending on team compositions. In particular, in the most commonly
used teams (when the CDF grows quickly on the right of the plot),
individuals are more likely to abuse than expected when losing.
Players who prefer leading roles are more abusive (Fig. 7b,
7c, 7d). There always exists a leader or a major contributor in a
team. In Honor of Kings, assassins usually take this role in a team
because of their explosiveness: assassins can carry the team and
control game pace. A failed assassin may lead the team to lose.
Fig. 7b shows that assassins are more likely to abuse than other
roles. We call this the “abusive assassin” phenomenon. One natural
question arises: are assassins more abusive because abusive players
tend to choose assassins, or players become more abusive when
choosing assassins?
To answer this question, we compare the abusing probability
of the same roles chosen by different players and the same player
choosing different roles. We define the experienced role for a player
if that player chooses a role frequently, i.e., playing in more than
50% of games. This procedure identifies experienced assassin players, experienced warrior players, etc. Fig. 7c presents the abusing
probability of experienced assassin players when they choose each
role (the same player choosing different roles). We observe that
these experienced assassin players are much more likely to abuse
than other players no matter what role they choose.
Fig. 7d examines the alternative hypothesis: players become more
abusive when choosing assassins. We compare the same player’s
abusing probability when they choose assassins with choosing other
roles, grouped by their experienced roles. We find that players do
not become more abusive when choosing assassins. If anything,
experienced mages and experienced marksmen are actually more
abusive when they choose roles other than assassins.

roles. Fig. 8a compares the abusing probability when a
player plays his experienced role with when playing inexperienced roles. In Fig. 8b, x-axis denotes the number of experienced roles (defined by given threshold) among teammates,
while y-axis denotes individual abusing probability.
Overall, our results in Honor of Kings support the hypothesis
that abusive players tend to choose assassins, the leading role in a
team, and players do not become abusive when choosing assassins.
Experienced players are more likely to abuse, but not when
they play with other experienced players (Fig. 8). Studies have
shown that experienced individuals tend to abuse novices [23]. We
hypothesize that a player is more likely to abuse when playing his
experienced role. In addition to using 50% as a threshold to define
experienced roles, we also use 70% and 60% here. Fig. 8a shows that
players are more abusive when playing their experienced roles no
matter what threshold is.
We next further explore how players are influenced by teammates when choosing experienced roles. Fig. 8b shows that as the
number of experienced roles increases among a player’s teammates,
his individual abusing probability player decreases (since this analysis requires historical information of every team member, it is done
on prediction games). This observation indicates that a player becomes more likely to abuse when choosing experienced roles partly
because other less experienced players do not meet this experienced
player’s expectation and cause frustration.
6 PREDICTION EXPERIMENTS
In this section, we set up three prediction tasks for winning, surrendering, and abusing respectively to further examine the effect of
team composition in a predictive setting. Overall, we find that features based on team composition consistently outperform features
based on individual players.
6.1 Experiment Setup
Prediction tasks and evaluation metrics. Our goal is to evaluate whether modeling team composition brings extra predictive
power to modeling individual players. Because team composition
cannot be altered after a game starts, we focus on making predictions before a game starts and consider the following three prediction tasks. Our results can potentially inform both players in
choosing roles and the matching-making system to match players.
• Winning team prediction[46]. This task aims to predict which
team will win before the game starts. We randomly swap the
order of two teams and label a game positive if the first team wins
and negative if the second team wins. This leads to a balanced
dataset, so we use accuracy for evaluation.
• Surrender prediction. This task aims to predict whether the losing
team surrenders in a game. Only 8K games (10.5%) end with
surrender, so we use F1 as evaluation metric in this task.
• Abuse prediction. Before a game starts, this task predicts whether
abusive language use happens in the game. Abusive language use
happens in 44K games (57.93%), so we use accuracy for evaluation
in this task.
Feature sets. We consider the following feature sets.
• Baseline. People’s mood varies over time and is associated with
abusive language use [12]. Our baseline features include day of
the week and hour of the day encoded as one-hot vectors.
• Player information. Depending on the task, we compute each
player’s rank level, winning rates in the last 10 ranked games,
surrender probability, and abusing probability from historical
games. We use the average, max, min, and standard deviation of
those properties of all players in a team as features.

Figure 9: Prediction results. Gray lines indicate the performance of a majority baseline in Fig. 9a and 9d, and a random baseline
in 9c. Features that incorporate role combinations with player information (role prop.) consistently outperform others.
• Role properties. A role combination of k refers to all possible
combinations of k roles. For instance, one-role combinations refer to the five roles in Table 1, two-role combinations refer to 15
possible combinations of two roles (
5
1

+

5
2

). We further incorporate player information in role combinations of both teams.
For each role combination in a team, we compute the average of
role-based player information in an instance of that combination
and then use the average, max, min, and std of all instances in
that combination as features. Taking an example to further explain role-based player information, the feature winning rate of
role c for player v is defined as the probability of v wins when she
plays c. We only consider up to two-role combinations (k ≤ 2)
when comparing prediction performances. Later we will explore
the effect of considering three-role combinations up to five-role
combinations, i.e., full team compositions.
We also use the union of all feature sets (“total”). Because we
find that game duration plays an important role in surrender, we
add game duration to every feature set for surrender prediction. In
abuse prediction, we do not distinguish two teams.
Prediction setup. For each task, we conduct 5-fold nested crossvalidations on prediction games in the third week and player information is extracted from historical games in the first two weeks. We
use Xgboost [11] since it is often the winning solution in Kaggle
competitions and shows strong performance compared to other
methods such as logistic regression in our preliminary experiments.
We grid search hyperparameters in max depth ({1, 3, 5, 7, 9}), learning rate ({0.1, 0.2}), and number of estimators ({100, 200, 300}).
6.2 Experiment Results
Prediction performance (Fig. 9a, 9b, 9c, and 9d). In all prediction tasks, we observe a consistent pattern that total > role property
> player information > baseline. Player information achieves relatively better performance than baselines since individual characteristics definitely influence team effectiveness in some degree.
By incorporating player information with role combinations, role
properties consistently outperform player information. The extra
predictive power from modeling team composition can be reflected
by the difference between total and player information: e.g., 70.4%
vs 67.7% in winning prediction for all games, and 67.8% vs 65.0%
in abusing prediction. In winning prediction, the effect of team 1 2 3 4 5

composition is further amplified when the rank gap being controlled: 56.3% vs 53.3%. The difference is the least prominent in
the prediction of surrender, as this behavior is often highly influenced by teammates and various situations during games, while
role properties still improve the performance by 1.5% in surrender
prediction.
Recall that Fig. 3b shows a clear influence of rank level on winning rate. Therefore, to further understand the effect of team compositions, we report the performance on games where the rank
level gap δ = 0 in Fig. 9b. We find that after the rank level gap is
controlled, this task becomes much more challenging and the performance of all feature sets drop significantly compared to Fig. 9a.
However, the difference between role properties and player information almost doubles (1.6% vs. 0.9%), demonstrating the effectiveness of incorporating team compositions, especially when the two
teams are similarly skilled. In contrast, rank level does not affect
the performance when predicting surrender or abuse.
Modeling two-role combinations is sufficient to capture the
effect of team composition (Fig. 10). To further illustrate the
effect of team compositions, we examine the performance of adding
k-role combinations to player information and baseline one by
one: we first add single-role features, then add features based on
two-role combinations, until adding features based on entire team
compositions. Taking winning team (on all games) and abuse prediction as examples, Fig. 10 shows that the performance improvement

saturates after adding two-role combinations. It suggests that modeling single roles and two-role combinations provides most of the
predictive power.
Feature analysis. We finally explore the importance of features by
using winning team prediction task as an example. When combining
role properties and player information, average rank levels of two
teams are the most important features (ranked top-2), as well as
average individual winning probability (in top-5). To understand
the key features in role properties, we show the top five features
in role properties in Table 4. Consistent with the characteristics
of roles where mage ( ), marksman ( ) and warrior ( ) are
most commonly used, the combinations of these roles are more
important in role properties. And as marksman ( ) and mage
( ) are the key roles to cause damages, role combinations related
with these roles are particularly significant. The first three of the top
five are all two-role features, which again indicates that modeling
two-role combinations is effective to capture the team performance.
7 RELATED WORK
In addition to studies mentioned throughout the paper, we discuss
additional related work in three strands.
Team formation. Researchers from the data mining community
have formulated the problem of team formulation as a constrained
optimization problem based on each individual’s skills and their social networks [2, 3, 30, 31]. For instance, Anagnostopoulos et al. [3]
take into account of the task requirements, individual workloads,
and team communication costs. Li et al. [31] study a family of problems in team enhancement including team member replacement,
team expansion, and team shrinkage.
Social/team roles. Digitalization of human traces have increasingly made implicit social/team roles explicit and enabled largescale study on theories of social/team roles [6–8, 47]. Yang et al. [49]
study how social roles influence the process of online information
diffusion. Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil et al. [16] demonstrate changes
in language use after a Wikipedia user becomes an administrator.
Yang et al. [47] infer editor roles on Wikipedia based on behavior
traces. In the context of gaming, Stetina et al. [42] examined problematic gaming behavior and depressive tendencies among people
who play different types of online-games.
Online gaming. Many researchers have recognized that online
gaming, especially MOBA and MMOGs (Massively Multiplayer Online Games), can serve as a platform for studying individual and
team behavior, group norms, and communities [20, 27]. In such
games, players not only develop individual skills, but also coordinate and communicate with others. The existence, significance, and
influence of such social interactions have been examined in many
studies [19, 22, 24, 32, 44].
Team performance is the most heavily studied topic among our
three measures of effectiveness. Pobiedina et al. [37, 38] explore
factors that influence player’s performance in Dota 2 and reveal that
team-level interactions, especially the number of friends in a team,
relate to team performance. Similar to our work, prior studies such
as [1, 15] demonstrate that different role combinations may greatly
influence team performance. Deep learning based recommendation
systems are also built to recommend heroes or roles to players[40].
Furthermore, gamification can also potentially play an important role in education and scientific discovery [26]. In particular,
Petter [36] suggests that researchers should embrace the growing
popularity of online gaming and seek opportunities in studying
online gaming in the context of education, individual, and team
behavior. In addition to these exciting opportunities, online gaming
leads to issues such as addiction and depression [28, 42].
8 CONCLUSION
In this paper, we study the effect of team composition in the largest
multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game: Honor of Kings. We
quantitatively show the varying effects of team composition on
team performance (winning), team tenacity (surrender), and team
rapport (abusive language use): although diverse teams tend to
perform well and show tenacity in adversity, they are more likely
to abuse when losing. The double-edged influence of team diversity
suggests the importance of balancing team composition. We also
examine how team composition influences individual behavior in
abusive language use. In addition to showing that a team is not
the sum of independent individuals, we contribute to the “situation vs. personality” debate and show that assassins abuse more
because abusive players tend to choose assassins instead of players
becoming abusive when choosing assassins. Our work suggests
that the gaming environment may be improved by adjusting team
matching and preventing players from using team compositions
that correlate with increased abusive language use.
Limitations. Although we control for roles in the analyses and
further validate our results through prediction experiments, our
study is observational and can be strengthened through experimental studies. We would like to highlight that experimental studies on
team compositions are non-trivial because of the great number of
possible combinations. Our work is also limited by the data that we
have access to. Due to privacy issues, we do not have sensitive individual information like location and consumption record. Moreover,
although Honor of Kings is the largest MOBA game, the selection
bias in our data may limit the generalizability of our findings.
Future directions. Several promising directions arise from our
work. Our prediction experiments show that it is important to incorporate individual player information with role combinations.
It remains challenging to develop a holistic model that captures
the interaction between individual members, learns novel representations for role combinations, and makes even more accurate
predictions. Furthermore, although MOBA games provide an ideal
environment for understanding the effect of team composition, it
is important to validate our findings in other scenarios, e.g., with
implicit roles beyond gaming.
