In all competitions where results are based upon an individual’s performance the question of
whether the outcome is a consequence of skill or luck arises. We explore this question through an
analysis of a large dataset of approximately one million contestants playing Fantasy Premier League,
an online fantasy sport where managers choose players from the English football (soccer) league.
We show that managers’ ranks over multiple seasons are correlated and we analyse the actions taken
by managers to increase their likelihood of success. The prime factors in determining a manager’s
success are found to be long-term planning and consistently good decision-making in the face of
the noisy contests upon which this game is based. Similarities between managers’ decisions over
time that result in the emergence of ‘template’ teams, suggesting a form of herding dynamics taking
place within the game, are also observed. Taken together, these findings indicate common strategic
considerations and consensus among successful managers on crucial decision points over an extended
temporal period.
I. INTRODUCTION
Hundreds of millions of people consume sporting content each week, motivated by several factors. These motivations include the fact that the spectator enjoys both
the quality of sport on display and the feeling of eustress
arising from the possibility of an upset [1, 2]. This suggests that there are two important elements present in
sporting competition: a high level of skill among players
that provides aesthetic satisfaction for the spectator and
also an inherent randomness within the contests due to
factors such as weather, injuries, and in particular luck.
The desire for consumers to get further value from their
spectating of sporting content has resulted in the emergence of fantasy sports [3–6], in which the consumers, or
managers as we shall refer to them throughout this article, begin the season with a virtual budget from which
to build a team of players who, as a result of partaking in the real physical games, receive points based upon
their statistical performances. The relationship between
the fantasy game and its physical counterpart raises the
question of whether those who take part in the former
suffer (or gain) from the same combination of skill and
luck that makes their physical counterpart enjoyable.
The emergence of large scale quantities of detailed data
describing the dynamics of sporting games has opened up
new opportunities for quantitative analysis, both from
a team perspective [7–14] and also at an individual
level [15–21]. This has resulted in analyses aiming to determine two elements within the individual sports; firstly
quantifying the level of skill in comparison to luck in
these games [9, 22–25] while, secondly, identifying characteristics that suggest a difference in skill levels among
the competing athletes [17, 26]. Such detailed quantitative analysis is not, however, present in the realm of
fantasy sports, despite their burgeoning popularity with
an estimated 45.9 million players in the United States
alone in 2019 [27]. One notable exception is a recent
study [28], which derived an analytical quantity to determine the role chance plays in many contests including
fantasy sports based on American sports, and suggested
that skill was a more important factor than luck in the
games.
Motivated by this body of work, we consider a dataset
describing the Fantasy Premier League (FPL) [29], which
is the online fantasy game based upon the top division
of England’s football league. This game consists of over
seven million managers, each of whom builds a virtual
team based upon real-life players. Before proceeding, we
here introduce a brief summary of the rules underlying
the game, to the level required to comprehend the following analysis [30]. The (physical) Premier League consists
of 20 teams, each of whom play each other twice, resulting
in a season of 380 fixtures split into 38 unique gameweeks,
with each gameweek generally containing ten fixtures. A
manager in FPL has a virtual budget of £100m at the
initiation of the season from which they must build a
squad of 15 players from the approximately 600 available. Each player’s price is set initially by the game’s
developers based upon their perceived value to the manager within the game, rather than their real-life transfer value. The squad of 15 players is composed under a
highly constrained set of restrictions which are detailed
in Supplementary Note I.
In each gameweek the manager must choose 11 players from their squad as their team for that week and
is awarded a points total from the sum of the performances of these players (see Supplementary Table 1).
The manager also designates a single player of the 11
to be the captain, with the manager receiving double
this players’ points total in that week. Between consecutive gameweeks the manager may also make one unpenalised change to their team, with additional changes
coming as a deduction in their points total. The price of
a given player then fluctuates as a result of the supplyand-demand dynamic arising from the transfers across
all managers’ rosters. The intricate rules present multiple
decisions to the manager and also encourages longer-term

strategising that factors in team value, player potential,
and many other elements.
In Section II A we analyse the historical performance
of managers in terms of where they have ranked within
the competition alongside their points totals in multiple seasons, in some cases over a time interval of up to
thirteen years. We find a consistent level of correlation
between managers’ performances over seasons, suggesting a persistent level of skill over an extended temporal
scale. Taking this as our starting point, in Section II B we
aim to understand the decisions taken by managers which
are indicative of this skill level over the shorter temporal
period of the 38 gameweeks making up the 2018/19 season by analysing the entire dataset of actions taken by
the majority of the top one million managers1 over the
course of the season. Even at this shorter scale we find
consistent tiers of managers who, on a persistent basis,
outperform those at a lower tier.
With the aim of identifying why these differences occur, we present (Section II C) evidence of consistently
good decision making with regard to team selection and
strategy. This would be consistent with some common
form of information providing these skilled managers
with an ‘edge’ of sorts, for example in the US it has
been suggested that 30% of fantasy sports participants
take advantage of further websites when building their
teams [31]. Arguably most interesting of all, in Sec1 Due to data availability issues at the time of collection such as
managers not taking part in the entire season, the final number
of managers identified was actually 901,912. We will however,
for the sake of brevity, refer to these as the top 1 million managers over the course of this article. It is also important to note
that data from previous seasons is unattainable, which is why we
restrict this detailed study to the 2018/19 season.
tion II D we demonstrate how at points throughout the
season there occurs temporary herding behaviour in the
sense that managers appear to converge to consensus on
a template team. However, the consensus does not persist in time, with managers subsequently differentiating
themselves from the others. We consider possible reasons and mechanisms for the emergence of these template
teams.
II. RESULTS
A. Historical Performance of Players
We consider two measures of a manager’s performance
in a given season of FPL: the total number of points their
team has obtained over the season and also their resulting rank based on this points total in comparison to all
other managers. A strong relationship between the managers’ performances over multiple seasons of the game is
observed. For example, in panel (a) of Fig. 1 we compare
the ranks of managers who competed in both the 2018-19
and 2017-18 seasons. The density near the diagonal of
this plot suggests a correlation between performances in
consecutive seasons. Furthermore, we highlight specifically the bottom left corner which indicates that those
managers who are among the most highly ranked appear
to perform well in both seasons. Importantly, if we consider the top left corner of this plot it can be readily
seen that the highest performing managers in the 2017-
18 season, in a considerable number of cases, did not finish within the lowest positions in the following season as
demonstrated by the speckled bins with no observations.
This is further corroborated in panel (b), in which we
show the pairwise Pearson correlation between the total

points obtained by managers from seasons over a period
of 12 years. While the number of managers who partook
in two seasons tends to decrease with time, a considerable
number are present in each comparison. Between the two
seasons shown in Fig. 1(a) for example, we observe results
for approximately three million managers and find a correlation of 0.42 among their points totals. Full results
from 13 consecutive seasons, including the number managers present in each pair and the corresponding Pearson
correlation coefficients, are given in Supplementary Table
4.
Using a linear regression fit to the total points scored
in the 2018/19 season as a function of the number of
previous seasons in which the manager has played (Supplementary Figure 3) we find that each additional year of
experience is worth on average 22.1 (R2 = 0.082) additional points (the overall winner in this season obtained
2659 points). This analysis suggests that while there are
fluctuations present in a manager’s performance during
each season of the game, there is also some consistency
in terms of performance levels, suggesting a combination
of luck and skill being present in fantasy sports just as
was observed in their physical analogue in [28].
B. Focus on Season 2018-19
In Sec. II A we considered, over multiple seasons, the
performance of managers at a season level in terms of
their cumulative performance over the 38 gameweeks of
each season. We now focus at a finer time resolution, to
consider the actions of managers at the gameweek level
for the single season 2018/19, in order to identify elements of their decision making which determined their
overall performance in the game.
The average points earned by all managers throughout the season is shown in Fig. 2(a) along with the 95
inter-percentile range, i.e., the values between which the
managers ranked in quantiles 0.025 to 0.975 appear. This
quantity exhibits more frequent fluctuations about its
long-term average (57.05 points per gameweek) in the
later stages of the season, suggesting that some elements
of this stage of the season cause different behaviour in
these gameweeks. There may of course be many reasons for this e.g., difficult fixtures or injuries for generally
high-scoring players or even simply a low/high scoring
gameweek, which are themselves factors of luck within
the sport itself (see Supplementary Table 2 for a detailed
break down of points per gameweek). However, in Section II C 3 we analyse an important driver of the fluctuations related to strategic decisions of managers in these
gameweeks.
In each season some fixtures must be rescheduled due
to a number of reasons, e.g., clashing fixtures in European
competitions, which results in certain gameweeks that
lack some of the complete set of ten fixtures. Such scenarios are known as blank-gameweeks (BGW) and their fixtures are rescheduled to another gameweek in which some
teams play twice; these are known as double-gameweeks
(DGWs). In the case of the 2018/19 season these BGWs
took place in GWs 27 (where there were eight fixtures),
31 (five fixtures), and 33 (six fixtures), making it difficult
for some managers to have 11 starting players in their
team. The DGWs feature some clubs with two games
and therefore players in a manager’s team who feature in
these weeks will have twice the opportunity for points; in
the 2018/19 season these took place in GWs 25 (where
11 games were played), 32 (15), 34 (11), and 35 (14).
We see that the main swings in the average number of
points are actually occurring in these gameweeks (aside
from the last peak in GW 36 which we will comment on
4
later in the article). In Section II C 3 we show that the
managers’ attitude and preparation towards these gameweeks are in fact indicators of their skill and ability as a
fantasy manager.
To analyse the impact of decision-making upon final
ranks, we define tiers of managers by rank-ordering them
by their final scores and then splitting into the top 103
,
top 104
, top 105
, and top 106 positions. These disjoint tiers of managers, i.e., the top 103
is the managers
with ranks between 1 and 1000, the top 104
those with
ranks between 1001 and 10,000 and so on, range from
the most successful (top 103
) to the relatively unsuccessful (top 106
) and so provide a basis for comparison (see
Supplementary Table 2 and Supplementary Table 3 for
summaries of points obtained by each tier). The average performance of the managers in each tier (relative to
the baseline average over the entire dataset) are shown in
panel (b) of Fig. 1. Note that the points for the top 106
tier are generally close to zero as the calculation of the
baseline value is heavily dependent upon this large bulk
of managers. A detailed summary of each tier’s points total, along with visualisation of the distribution of points
total may be found in Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Figure 1. It appears that the top tier managers outperform those in other tiers, not only in specific
weeks but consistently throughout the season which results in the competition for places in this top tier more
difficult to obtain as the season progresses (Supplementary Figure 2). This is particularly noticeable in the first
gameweek, where the top 103 managers tended to perform very strongly, suggesting a high level of preparation
(in terms of squad-building) prior to the physical league
starting. We also comment that the largest gaps between
the best tier and the worst tier occur not only in two of
the special gameweeks (DGW 35 and BGW 33) but also
in GW 1, which suggests that prior to the start of the
season these managers have built a better-prepared team
to take advantage of the underlying fixtures. We note
however that all tiers show remarkably similar temporal
variations in their points totals, in the sense that they all
experience simultaneous peaks and troughs during the
season. See Supplementary Table 2 for a full breakdown
of these values alongside their variation for each gameweek.
Having identified both differences and similarities underlying the performance in terms of total points for different tiers of managers we now turn to analysis of the
actions that have resulted in these dynamics.
C. Decision-Making
1. Transfers
The performance of a manager over the season may be
viewed as the consequence of a sequence of decisions that
the manager made at multiple points in time. These decisions include which players in their squad should feature

in the starting team, the formation in which they should
set up their team, and many more. In the following sections we consider multiple scenarios faced by managers
and show that those who finished within a higher tier
tended to consistently outperform those in lower tiers.
One decision the manager must make each gameweek
is whether to change a player in their team by using a
transfer. If the manager wants to make more than one
transfer they may also do so but at the cost of a points
deduction for each extra transfer. The distribution of
total points made from transfers, which we determine
by the difference between points attained by the player
the manager brought in for the following gameweek compared to the player whom they transferred out, over the
entire season for each tier is shown in Fig. 3(a). The
average number for each tier is also shown. To further
analyse this scenario we calculate, for each gameweek, the
number of better transfers the managers could have made
with the benefit of perfect foresight, given the player they
transferred out. This involves taking all players with
a price less than or equal to that of the player transferred out and calculating the fraction of options which
were better than the one selected, i.e., those who received
more points the following gameweek (see Methods). Figure 3(b) shows the complementary cumulative distribution function (CCDF) of this quantity for each tier, note
the steeper decrease of the CCDFs for the higher tiers
implies that these managers were more likely to choose a
strong candidate when replacing a player.
A second decision faced by managers in each gameweek
is the choice of player to nominate as captain, which results in the manager receiving double points for this players’ actions during the GW. This is, of course, a difficult
question to answer as the points received by a player
can be a function of both their own actions i.e., scoring or assisting a goal, and also their team’s collective
performance (such as a defender’s team not conceding a
goal). This topic is an identification question which may
be well suited to further research making use of the data
describing the players and teams but with additional data
about active managers who are making the same decision.
For example, an analysis of the captaincy choice of managers based upon their social media activity was recently
presented in [32] and showed that the wisdom of crowds
concept performs comparably to that of the game’s top
managers. Panel (c) of Fig. 3 shows the distribution of
points obtained by managers in each tier from their captaincy picks. Again we observe that the distribution of
points obtained over the season is generally larger for
those managers in higher tiers.
2. Financial Cognizance
The financial ecosystem underlying online games has
been a focus of recent research [33, 34]. With this in
mind, we consider the importance of managers’ financial awareness in impacting their performance. As men-

tioned previously, each manager is initially given a budget of £100 million to build their team, constrained by
the prices of the players which, themselves fluctuate over
time. While the dynamics of player price changes occur
via an undisclosed mechanism, attempts to understand
this process within the community of Fantasy Premier
League managers have resulted in numerous tools to help
managers predict player price changes during the season,
for example see [35]. The resulting algorithms are in general agreement that the driving force behind the changes
is the supply and demand levels for players.
These price fluctuations offer an opportunity for the
astute manager to ‘play the market’ and achieve a possible edge over their rivals and allow their budget to be
more efficiently spent (see Supplementary Figure 4 for a
description of player value and their corresponding points
totals and Supplementary Figure 5 for an indication of
how the managers distribute their budget by player position). At a macro level this phenomenon of price changes
is governed by the aforementioned supply and demand,
but these forces are themselves governed by a number of
factors affecting the player including, but not limited to,
injuries, form, and future fixture difficulty. As such, managers who are well-informed on such aspects may profit
from trading via what is in essence a fundamental analysis of players’ values by having them in their team prior to
the price rises [36]. Interestingly, we note that the general trend of team value is increasing over time among
our managers as shown in panel (a) of Fig 4 along with
corresponding 95 percentiles of the distribution, although
there is an indicative decrease between weeks towards the
season’s end (GWs 31-35) suggesting the team value becomes less important to the managers towards the games
conclusion. Equivalent plots for each tier are shown in
Supplementary Figure 6.
Probing further into the relationship between finance
and the managers’ rank, we show in Fig. 4(b) the distribution of team values for the top two tiers (top 103
and top 104
), compared with that for the bottom two
tiers (top 105 and top 106
) There is a clear divergence
between the two groups from an early point in the season, indicating an immediate importance being placed
upon the value of their team. A manager who has a rising team value is at an advantage relative to one who
does not due to their increased purchasing power in the
future transfer market. This can be seen in panel (c) of
Fig. 4 which shows the change in team value for managers
at gameweek 19, the halfway point of the season, versus
their final points total. A positive relationship appears
to exist and this is validated by fitting an OLS Linear
Regression with a slope of 21.8 (R2 = 0.1689), i.e., an
increase of team value by £1M at the halfway point is
worth, on average, an additional 21.8 points by the end
of the game (for the same analysis in other gameweeks
see Supplementary Table 5). The rather small R2 value
suggests, however, that the variation in a managers’ final
performance is not entirely explained by their team value
and as such we proceed to analyse further factors which
can play a part in their final ranking.
3. Chip Usage
A further nuance to the rules of FPL is the presence of
four game-chips, which are single use ‘tricks’ that may be
used by a manager in any GW to increase their team’s
performance, by providing additional opportunities to
obtain points. The time at which these chips are played
and the corresponding points obtained are one observable
7
element of a managers’ strategy. A detailed description
for each of the chips and analysis of the approach taken
by the managers in using them is given in Supplementary
Note V.
For the sake of brevity we focus here only on one specific chip, the bench boost. When this chip is played, the
manager receives points from all fifteen players in their
squad in that GW, rather than only the starting eleven
as is customary. This clearly offers the potential for a
large upswing in points if this chip is played in an efficient manner, and as such it should ideally be used in
GWs where the manager may otherwise struggle to earn
points with their current team or weeks in which many of
their players have a good opportunity of returning large
point scores. The double and blank GWs might naively
appear to be optimal times to deploy this chip however
when the managers’ actions are analysed we see differing
approaches (and corresponding returns).
Figure 5 shows the proportion of managers who had
used the bench boost chip by each GW alongside the corresponding distribution of points the manager received
from this choice, where we have grouped the two higher
tiers into one group and the remaining managers in another for visualization purposes (see Supplementary Figure 10 & Supplementary Figure 11 and Supplementary
Table 7-Supplementary Table 10 for a breakdown of use
and point returns by each tier). It is clear that the majority of better performing managers generally focused on
using these chips during the double and blank GWs with
79.4% choosing to play their BB chip during DGW35
in comparison to only 28.9% of those in the rest of the
dataset. We also observe the difference in point returns as
a result of playing the chip, with the distribution for the
top managers being centred around considerable higher
values, demonstrating that their squads were better prepared to take advantage of this chip. The fact that the
managers were willing to wait until one of the final gameweeks is also indicative of the long-term planning that
separates them from those lower ranked. Similar results
can be observed for the other game-chips (Supplementary
Table 8-Supplementary Table 10). We also highlight that
a large proportion of managers made use of other chips
in GW36, which was the later gameweek in which there
was a large fluctuation from the average shown in Fig. 2.
Finally, we comment on the fact that some managers
did not employ their chips by the game’s conclusion
which suggests that either they were not aware of them
or, more likely, the mangers in question had simply lost
interest in the game at this point. As such, the quantity of managers who had not used their chip gives us a
naive estimation of the retention rate for active managers
in Fantasy Premier League (85.05% of managers in our
dataset). We note that this is a biased estimate in the
sense that our dataset is only considering the top tiers
of managers, or at least those who finished in the top
tiers, and one would expect the drop out rate to be in
fact much higher in lower bands.
D. Template Team
While the preceding analysis proposes reasons for the
differences between points obtained by tiers shown in
Fig. 2, the question remains as to why the managers’
gameweek points totals show similar temporal dynamics. In order to understand this we consider here the
underlying structure of the managers’ teams. We show
that a majority of teams feature a core group of players that results in a large proportion of teams having
a similar make-up. We call this phenomenon the template team which appears to emerge at different points
in the season; this type of collective behaviour has been
observed in such social settings previously, see, for example [37, 38]. We identify the template team by using the
network structure describing the teams of all managers,
which is described by the adjacency matrix AG
ij , whereby
an edge between two players i and j appearing in n teams
for a given gameweek G describes a value in the matrix
given by AG
ij = n. This matrix is similar in nature to the
co-citation matrix used within the field of bibliometrics
[39], see Fig. 6 for a representation of the process.
With these structures in place we proceed to perform
hierarchical clustering on the matrices in order to identify groups of players constituting the common building
blocks of the managers’ teams. By performing the algorithm with k = 4 clusters we find that three clusters contain only a small number of the 624 players, suggesting
that most teams include this small group of core players
(see Supplementary Table 6 for the identities of those in
the first cluster each gameweek). Figure 7(a) shows the
size of these first three clusters over all managers for each
gameweek of the season (Supplementary Figure 8 shows
the equivalent values for each tier). To understand this
result further, consider that at their largest these three
clusters only consist of 5.13% (32/624) of the available
players in the game, highlighting that the teams are congregated around a small group of players. For an example representation of this matrix alongside its constituent
clusters we show the structure in panel (b) of Fig. 7 for
gameweek 38, which was the point in time at which the
three clusters were largest.
To further examine the closeness between managers’
decisions we consider the Jaccard similarity between sets
of teams, which is a distance measure that considers both
the overlap and also total size of the sets for comparison
(see Methods for details). Figure 7(c) shows the average
of this measure over pairwise combinations of managers
from all tiers and also between pairs of managers who are
in the same tier. Fluctuations in the level of similarity
over the course of the season can be seen among all tiers
indicating times at which teams become closer to a template followed by periods in which managers appear to
differentiate themselves more from the peers. Also note
that the level of similarity between tiers increases with
rank suggesting that as we start to consider higher performing managers, their teams are more like one another
not only at certain parts of the season but, on average,

FIG. 6: Schematic representation of the approaches taken to identify similarity between the
composition of managers’ teams in each GW. We view the connections between managers and players as a
bipartite network such that an edge exists if the player is in the managers’ team. To determine the relationship
between players’ levels of popularity we use the co-occurrence matrix which has entries corresponding to the number
of teams in which two players co-appear. Using this matrix we perform hierarchical clustering techniques to identify
groups of players who are similarly popular within the game, where the number of clusters is determined by
analysing the within-cluster sum of squared errors. The similarity between the teams of two managers is determined
by calculating the Jaccard similarity, which is determined by the number of players that appear in both teams.
over its entirety (see Supplementary Figure 9 for corresponding plots for each tier individually). The high level
of similarity between the better managers’ teams in the
first gameweek (and the corresponding large points totals
seen in Supplementary Figure 1) is particularly interesting given that this is before they have observed a physical
game being played in the actual season. This suggests a
similar approach in identifying players based purely upon
their historical performance and corresponding value by
the more skilled managers.
III. DISCUSSION
The increasing popularity of fantasy sports in recent
years [27] enables the quantitative analysis of managers’
decision-making through the study of their digital traces.
The analysis we present in this article considers the game
of Fantasy Premier League, which is played by approximately seven million managers. We observe a consistent
level of skill among managers in the sense that there exists a considerable correlation between their performance
over multiple seasons of the game, in some cases over thirteen years. This result is particularly striking given the
stochastic nature of the underlying game upon which it
is based.
Encouraged by these findings, we proceeded to conduct
a deeper analysis of the actions taken by a large proportion of the top one million managers from the 2018-19
season of the game. This allowed each decision made
by these managers to be analysed using a variety of statistical and graphical tools. We divided the managers
into tiers based upon their final position in the game and
observed that the managers in the upper echelons consistently outperformed those in lower ones, suggesting
that their skill levels are present throughout the season
and that their corresponding rank is not dependent on
just a small number of events. The skill-based decisions
were apparent in all facets of the game, including making good use of transfers, strong financial awareness, and
taking advantage of short- and long-term strategic opportunities, such as their choice of captaincy and use of
the chips mechanic, see Section II C 3.
Arguably the most remarkable observation presented
in this article is, however, the emergence of what we coin
a template team that suggests a form of common collective behaviour occurring between managers. We show
that most teams feature a common core group of constituent players at multiple time points in the season.
This occurs despite the wide range of possible options
for each decision, suggesting that the managers are acting
similarly, and particularly so for the top-tier managers as

evident by their higher similarity metrics. Such coordinated behaviour by managers suggests an occurrence of
the so-called ‘superstar effect’ within fantasy sports just
as per their physical equivalent [40], whereby managers
independently arrive at a common conclusion on a core
group of players who are viewed as crucial to optimal
play. A further dimension is added by the fact that the
similarity between the teams of better managers is evident even prior to the first event of the season, i.e., they
had apparently all made similar (good) decisions even
‘before a ball was kicked’.
In this article we have focussed on the behaviour of
the managers and their decision-making that constitutes
their skill levels. The availability of such detailed data
offers the potential for further research from a wide range
of areas within the field of computational social science.
For example, analysis of the complex financial dynamics
taking place within the game as a result of the changing player values and the buying/selling decisions made
by the managers would be interesting. A second complementary area of research would be the development
of algorithms that consider the range of possible options
available to managers and give advice on optimizing point
returns. Initial analysis has recently been conducted [32]
in this area, including the optimal captaincy choice in
a given gameweek, and has demonstrated promising results.
In summary, we believe the results presented here offer
an insight into the behaviour of top fantasy sport managers that is indicative of both long-term planning and
collective behaviour within their peer group, demonstrating the intrinsic level of skill required to remain among
the top positions over several seasons, as observed in this
study. We are however aware that the correlations between decisions and corresponding points demonstrated
are not perfect, which is in some sense to be expected
due to the non-deterministic nature which makes the
sport upon which the game is based so interesting to the
millions of individuals who enjoy it each week. These
outcomes suggest a combination of skill and luck being
present in fantasy sport just as in their physical equivalent.
IV. METHODS
A. Data Collection
We obtained the data used in this study by accessing approximately 50 million unique URLs through
the Fantasy Premier League API. The rankings
at the end of the 2018/19 season were obtained
through https://fantasy.premierleague.com/
api/leagues-classic/{league-id}/standings/
from which we could obtain the entry ID of the
top 1 million ranked managers. Using these IDs we
then proceeded to obtain the team selections along
with other manager quantities for each gameweek
10
of this season that were used in the study through
https://fantasy.premierleague.com/api/entry/
{entry-id}/event/{GW}/picks/, we then filtered
the data to include only managers for whom we
had data for the entirety of the season which consisted of 901, 912 unique managers. The data for
individual footballers and their performances were captured via https://fantasy.premierleague.com/api/
bootstrap-static/. Finally, the historical performance
data was obtained for 6 million active managers through
https://fantasy.premierleague.com/api/entry/
{entry-id}/history/.
B. Calculation of Transfer Quality
In order to calculate the transfer quality plot shown
in Fig. 3(b) we consider the gameweeks in which managers made one transfer and, based upon the value of the
player whom they transferred in, determine what fraction of players with the same price or lower the manager
could have instead bought for their team. Suppose that
in gameweek G the manager transferred out player xi
,
who had value qG(xi), for player xj who scored pG(xj )
points in the corresponding gameweek. The calculation
involves firstly finding all players the manager could have
transferred in, i.e., those with price less than or equal to
qG(xi) and then determining the fraction yG(xi
, xj ) of
these players who scored more points than the chosen
player given the player whom was transferred out. This
is calculated by using
yG(xi
, xj ) =
P
k 1 [qG(xk) ≤ qG(xi)] · 1 [pG(xk) > pG(xj )]
P
` 1 [qG(x`) ≤ qG(xi)] ,
where 1 represents the indicator function. Using this
quantity we proceed to group over the entire season for
each tier of manager which allows us to obtain the distribution of the measure itself and finally the probability
of making a better transfer which is shown in panel (b)
of Fig. 3.
C. Team Similarity
With the aim of identifying levels of similarity between
the teams of two managers i and j we make use of the
Jaccard similarity which is a measure used to describe
the overlap between two sets. Denoting by T
G
i
the set of
players that appeared in the squad of manager i during
gameweek G we consider the Jaccard similarity between
the teams of managers i and j for gameweek G given by
J
G(i, j) =

T
G
i ∩ T
G
j



T
G
i ∪ T
G
j


,
where | · | represents the cardinality of the set. We then
proceed to calculate this measure for all n managers
which results in a n × n symmetric matrix J
G, the (i, j)
element of which is given by the above equation, note
that the diagonal elements of this matrix are unity. Calculation of this quantity over all teams is computationally
expensive in the sense that one must perform pair-wise
comparison of the n teams for each gameweek. As such
we instead calculated an estimate of this quantity by taking random samples without replacement of 100 teams
from each tier and calculating the measure both over all
teams and also within tiers for each gameweek. We repeat this calculation 10,000 times and the average results
are those used in the main text and Supplementary Note
IV.
D. Cluster Identification of Player Ownership
As described in the main text, the calculation of clusters within which groups of players co-appear involves
taking advantage of the underlying network structure of
all sets of teams. The adjacency matrix describing this
network is defined by the matrix AG
ij that has entry (i, j)
equal to the number of teams within which player i and
j co-appear in gameweek G. Note that the diagonal entries of this matrix describe the number of teams in which
a given player appears gameweek G. Using this matrix
we identify the clusters via a hierarchical clustering approach, with k = 4 clusters determined via analysing the
within-cluster sum of squared errors of k-means for each
cluster using the elbow method as shown in Supplementary Figure 7.

Supplemental Materials
Supplementary Note I. Summary of Rules of Fantasy Premier League
The decisions made by the managers of Fantasy Premier League are governed by a stringent set of rules [30]. The
initial restrictions of the game is that the manager must select a squad of 15 players consisting of two goalkeepers, five
defenders, five midfielders, and three forwards. The total value of these players may not exceed £100M and a further
restriction is that no more than three players from one club may appear in a given squad. Each week the manager
must then select a starting 11 players which must include one goalkeeper and a minimum of three defenders, three
midfielders, and one forward, this restriction is known as the formation criterion. These players are the ones whose
performance contributes to the managers’ points total. The remaining players feature on the ‘bench’ and are ordered
by the manager such that if one of their starting players does not appear the first placed bench players’ points are
given to the manager (provided the formation criterion remains satisfied by said first choice bench player).
Players selected by a manager are rewarded points based upon their statistical performance during the physical
matches they compete in. Points for specific actions vary by the players’ position, for example, a defender receives
more points for scoring a goal than a forward due to the relative rarity of such an event. In Supplementary Table
1 we show the points per position for each of the possible actions the players may be rewarded/penalised for. For a
goalkeeper or defender to be classified as keeping a clean sheet they must have played at least 60 minutes, excluding
stoppage time. For example, if a defender was substituted in the physical game with the score at 0-0 in the 63rd
minute, and their team proceeded to concede a goal then the defender in question would receive clean sheet points
but the remaining players would not. Also, in the case of a goal scored directly from a set piece i.e., a free-kick or
penalty, the player who was fouled in the awarding of the set piece receives the assist.
Managers may proceed to make changes to their team between gameweeks which involves transferring a player from
their team for another with the same position. Each week a manager is entitled to one such transfer known as a free
transfer. Additional transfers may be made but at a cost of four points each from their points total. If the manager
does not make use of their free transfer the following gameweek they may then make two free transfers however it is
not possible to accumulate more than two free transfers. The aforementioned restrictions regarding positions, clubs,
and value must be satisfied for each transfer.
In terms of the points amassed by the managers observed in the study we show the points totals and the number
of manager who obtained them in panel (a) of Supplementary Figure 1. We firstly comment on the skewness of
the distribution with the number of managers obtaining a certain number of points decreasing quickly as the points
becomes larger. The large gap between the points obtained by the overall winner (2659) and those of second place
(2602) is also interesting. The distribution of points within each tier is shown in Supplementary Figure 1(b), we
see the same skewness being present in each of these distributions, and also the presence of outliers among the top
ranked positions. Summary statistics for each tier and also all managers are given in Supplementary Table 2 and
Supplementary Table 3. To view how the ranks of managers change over the course of the season we show the flow
of manager position in Supplementary Figure 2. All managers are considered in panel (a) while those who finished
in the top 104 positions are shown in (b). We see the competition for the top positions by the fact that no manager
who is outside the top 106
ranks at gameweek 20 finishes within the top 106
tier.

Supplementary Note II. Historical Correlations
To obtain the historical data we considered managers taking part in the 2019/20 season of the game for which we
found ≈ 6 million managers, of whom ≈ 3.8 million had taken part in a previous season. We then determined their
historical performance in terms of both points earned and overall rank for each season in which they partook in the
game. These quantities are the only two available at the historical level, unlike the gameweek level of resolution studied
in the main text. We then proceeded to identify the number of managers for whom we have data in each pairwise
combination of seasons, shown in the lower elements of Supplementary Table 4, and calculated Pearson correlations
between their points totals in each case represented by the upper elements of the same table. These correlations are
visualised in Fig. 1 of the main text. The two single blocks in the figure represent the winner (who had played in six
previous seasons) and the runner-up (three previous seasons).
We also consider the relationship between the number of previous seasons that the managers took part in and
their points totals in the 2018/19 seasons as shown in Supplementary Figure 3. We comment on the small number of
managers present in the bottom right corner of the plot, suggesting that managers who have played for multiple years
are less likely to have obtained a lower points total, in line with the correlation results obtained in Supplementary
Table 4. This positive relationship is also evident when one fits a linear regression to the data which suggests each
additional year’s experience is worth, on average, an additional 22 points.

Supplementary Note III. Financial Analysis
Here we briefly consider implications of the financial aspects of the game. Firstly, the price of players themselves
demonstrate some interesting dynamics. We remind the reader that initially the price of each player is set by the
developers of the game and this price subsequently fluctuates over the season depending on the supply and demand
of managers transferring the player in and out of their teams. A summary of the distribution of the average value
over the season for each of the ≈600 players coloured by their corresponding position is provided in panel (a) of
Supplementary Figure 4. We comment on the skewed distribution of points obtained in all cases but in particular for
midfielders and forwards. The corresponding points earned over the season by each of the players versus their average
price is shown in panel (b). We see that there is, in general, a positive relationship between the price of a player and
their corresponding points totals. As per their prices, we see a handful of midfielders and forwards who earn the most
points.
The make-up of the managers’ squad consists of two goalkeepers, five defenders, five midfielders, and three forwards.
Supplementary Figure 5 demonstrates the proportion of budget spend in these three positions (we have grouped
goalkeepers and defenders together) by all managers at GW 1. We observe some remarkable variation in where the
budget is spent, with some managers spending over half of their budget on midfield players despite of them only
accounting for a third of their squad. Due to the price of players fluctuating throughout the season, like an investor

holding a varying stock, the managers’ overall team value changes. Supplementary Figure 6 shows the average team
value of the managers by tier over each gameweek of the season along with corresponding 95% intervals of the
distribution. As per the main text we fit a linear regression to the total points obtained by all managers as a function
of their team value each gameweek, with results shown in Supplementary Table 5.
Supplementary Note IV. Team Similarity and Cluster Analysis
In this section we show more information regarding the hierarchical clustering analysis described in the main text.
Supplementary Figure 7 shows the scaled within sum of squared errors (WSS) for each number of clusters where the
error is calculated using k-means. We decide upon four clusters as the decrease in errors slows down at this point.
In order to give equal weighting to each gameweek we firstly calculate the WSS for each gameweek and rescale these
before averaging over these rescaled values over all gameweeks.
The sizes of these first three clusters for each tier are shown in Supplementary Figure 8 and follow a similar pattern
to that found for all managers in the main text. The top two tiers are shown in panel (a) and (b), however, do
appear to make use of fewer players which may be a function of the smaller number of teams to analyse It may also
be further evidence of the higher similarity between the teams in these tiers as suggested in Supplementary Figure 9,
which shows the Jaccard similarity (calculated as in the main text) for each of the tiers versus all other tiers. Finally,
for the interested reader we provide the identity of those players who appear in the first cluster when the analysis is
performed on all managers in Supplementary Table 6. We see frequent appearance of some higher priced players such
as Mohammed Salah and Sergio Agüero throughout the season. However, also interesting is the presence of some
extremely inexpensive players, in particular Aaron Wan-Bissaka who was appearing in his debut campaign and was
priced at the cheapest level as a £4M defender but surprisingly made consistent appearances throughout the season,
which made him a very attractive option for skilful managers in order to spend more of their budget elsewhere.

Supplementary Note V. Chip Usage

Percentage of Budget by Position
Supplementary Figure 5: Ternary diagram demonstrating the make-up of managers’ squads in
gameweek one. The combination of proportions spent in each position (where DEF represents both goalkeepers
and defenders) is shown, where the colour in each bin represents the fraction of managers who used a given
combination of proportions.
1. Bench Boost (BB) - The manager receives the points awarded by all 15 players in their squad in comparison
to the usual starting 11 players.
2. Free Hit (FH) - The manager may make unlimited changes to their team for one gameweek, at the end of
which their team reverts to the squad from the previous GW, under the standard restriction, i.e., they must
remain under their budget, satisfy the formation criterion, and have no more than three players from any one
club.
3. Triple Captain (TC) - For the GW this chip is played in, the captain’s points are tripled rather than doubled.
If the captain does not play the triple points are awarded to the vice-captain and, as usual, if neither play no
one is awarded triple points.
The points obtained for each of these chips, the distributions of which are shown in Supplementary Figure 10, are
calculated by
1. Bench Boost (BB) - We identify the four players on the manager bench the week the chip was played and
tally their points total.
2. Free Hit (FH) - The amount of points the manger received that week is used in this case as the free hit
essentially acts like a free week to choose the eleven players of their desire with the aim of maximizing points
for one week i.e., no long-term planning is needed.
3. Triple Captain (TC) - The captain’s points total is shown in the distribution. We assume they would have
chosen this player to be captain regardless of the chip so would have received double points regardless and as
such the difference is only the single points score.

doing so. The corresponding figures are shown in Supplementary Table 7, Supplementary Table 8, and Supplementary
Table 9. A fourth chip also exists in the game and is known as the wildcard, this chip allows the manager to make as
many transfers as they like in the week it is played thus offering a chance to totally redefine their team. The managers
receive this chip twice in the season, the first may only be used between gameweeks 1 and 21, while the second in
one of the remaining gameweeks. It proves however much more difficult to quantify the return from this chip e.g.,
one could consider the wildcarded teams return versus their original team in the following m gameweeks, however in
practice the manager would make transfers to their original team in the following gameweeks, another issue is the
possibility that the manager ‘dead-ends’ their team up to the week of their wildcard gameweek in the sense that they
stop planning for beyond the wildcard opening up the possibility of an extremely biased comparison as the team being
changed arguably would not be there without the wildcard. We may still, however, consider the gameweek in which
the managers played each of their two chips and this is shown in Supplementary Figure 11 alongside the quantities
themselves in Supplementary Table 10. Looking at the point of season in which these chips are used we again notice
an evident pattern among the actions of the top managers particularly when the second wildcard chip is considered.
It appears as though the strategy of choice for those who finished in the top two tiers was to use their free hit during
double gameweek 32, wildcard in gameweek 34, and thus having what they believed to be an optimal squad such that
they could optimise their bench boost chip which most played in double gameweek 35.

Supplementary Figure 9: Jaccard similarity between managers in each tier with those in other tiers.
Calculation is repeated as described in Sec. IV C of the main text. The Jaccard similarity of teams in each tier is
compared with all other tiers, where we observe a stronger similarity between those in higher tiers indicating that
the better managers are more likely to have a similar structure.

Distribution of Points from Free Hit (f)
Supplementary Figure 10: Summary results for each of the three chips. We show the time of the chips’ use
along with the points received by the manager who played them, for manager who finished in the top 103 and 104
tiers (top 10k) in comparison to the remaining managers (top million) in the dataset. The left panels show the
proportion of managers who had used the corresponding chip by each GW (the complementary cumulative
distribution function), particularly highlighting the large usages in the ‘special’ gameweeks for each chip. The right
panels show the distribution of points received from the chip’s use by the two groups of managers, while the mean
number of points for each group are also shown by the dashed vertical lines. We comment on the fact that the top
10k received more points on average for each of the three chips.
