1 Introduction
Game theory is a discipline which stands from the game player’s point of view
with a focus on how to win a game. However, game designers would consider
another important aspect: how to make a game more attractive. With such
motivation, a new game theory from the game designer’s point of view, called
game refinement theory [2, 3] was proposed in the early 2000s. von Neumann [4]
was a pioneer who formed the foundation for the modern game theory, which has
widely been applied in various fields. For example, Shannon [5] and Turing [6]
proposed the basic framework for computer chess that is the minimax gametree search, being inspired by the concept of minimax equilibrium [4], typical
framework of computer chess called game-tree search was proposed by Shannon
[5] and Turing [6], respectively.
One direction with game theory was to find the best move in a game or
to ensure the possibility of winning the game based on the understanding of
current positions. Another direction with game refinement theory was to assess
the attractiveness or sophistication of a game. In particular, game refinement
theory gives a measure to quantify the sophistication of a game. This enables
to obtain the deep insight into the current game and improve the quality of the
game [7, 8].
The measure of game refinement can also be used to obtain the deep insight
into the history of games. For example, it is observed that the evolution of chess
has two different directions: one is to increase the search-space complexity and
another one is to shift to the comfortable degree of game refinement measure [9].
Hence, it gives a reasonable look on the evolution of specific game variants.
In another way, game refinement theory provides us with another viewpoint
of games from the entertainment aspect while game theory helps us understand
about the game’s mechanism itself. From that viewpoint, we can extend the idea
of game refinement into other domains in human life such as sports games, video
games, education or business. The possibility of extension comes from the core
idea of game refinement theory that is quantifying the engagement. In many
activities of human, the engagement is usually used as one of the important
standards to evaluate the effectiveness of those activities.
Game refinement theory has been widely applied to many different types
of games with the promising results. However, the theory has just one decade
history, which may not be established yet. This paper explores possible interpretations for game refinement measure. It highlights the bridging idea between
boardgames and continuous movement games like sports. Thus the meaning of
game refinement measure is discussed with a focus on the skill and chance aspects
in game playing. It will enable to have a new perspective of game refinement theory. Moreover, an example of interpretation for game refinement measure from
boardgames and continuous movement games such as MOBA game is shown.
2 An Overview of Game Refinement Theory
In this section an overview of game refinement theory is presented. The model
of game refinement was first investigated in the domain of boardgames such as
chess, later expanded into continuous movement games such as sports games
and video games while considering the gap between boardgames and continuous
movement games.
2.1 Original Model
We review the early work of game refinement theory from [2]. The decision
space is the minimal search space without forecasting. It provides the common
measures for almost all boardgames. The dynamics of decision options in the
decision space has been investigated and it is observed that this dynamics is a
key factor for game entertainment. Thus a measure of the refinement in games
was proposed [3].
Later, the following works are sketched from [7, 10] that expands the model
of game refinement which was cultivated in the domain of boardgames into
continuous movement games such as sports games and video games.
The game progress is twofold. One is game speed or scoring rate, while another one is game information progress with a focus on the game outcome. Game
information progress presents the degree of certainty of a game’s result in time
or in steps. Having full information of the game progress, i.e. after its conclusion,
game progress x(t) will be given as a linear function of time t with 0 ≤ t ≤ tk
and 0 ≤ x(t) ≤ x(tk), as shown in Eq. (1).
x(t) = x(tk)
tk
t (1)
However, the game information progress given by Eq. (1) is unknown during
the in-game period. The presence of uncertainty during the game, often until
the final moments of a game, reasonably renders game progress as exponential.
Hence, a realistic model of game information progress is given by Eq. (2).
x(t) = x(tk)( t
tk
)
n
(2)
Here n stands for a constant parameter which is given based on the perspective of
an observer of the game considered. Only a very boring game would progress in
a linear function, however, and most of course do not. Therefore, it is reasonable
to assume a parameter n, based on the perception of game progress prior to
completion. If the information of the game is completely known (i.e., after the
end of the game) and the value of n is 1, the game progress curve appears
as a straight line. In most games, especially in competitive ones, much of the
information is incomplete, the value of n cannot be assumed, and therefore game
progress is a steep curve until its completion, along with x(tk), tk, x(t) and t,
just prior to game’s end.
Then acceleration of game information progress is obtained by deriving Eq. (2)
twice. Solving it at t = tk, we have Eq. (3).
x
00(tk) = x(tk)
(tk)
n
(tk)
n−2 n(n − 1) = x(tk)
(tk)
2
n(n − 1) (3)
It is assumed in the current model that game information progress in any type
of game is encoded and transported in our brains. We do not yet know about
the physics of information in the brain, but it is likely that the acceleration
of information progress is subject to the forces and laws of physics. Too little
game information acceleration may be easy for human observers and players to
compute, and becomes boring. In contrast, too much game information acceleration surpasses the entertaining range and will be frustration, and at some points
beyond that could become overwhelming and incomprehensible.
Therefore, we expect that the larger the value x(tk)
(tk)
2 is, the more the game
becomes exciting, due in part to the uncertainty of game outcome. Thus, we
use its root square,
√
x(tk)
tk
, as a game refinement measure for the game under
consideration. We call it R value for short as shown in Eq. (4).
R =
p
x(tk)
tk

n(n − 1) = C

x(tk)

2.2 A Bridge between Sports and Boardgames
Here we consider the gap of game refinement model between boardgames and
sports games. We review the observation from [10]. One round in boardgames
can be illustrated as decision tree. At each depth of the game tree, one will
choose a move and the game will progress. Figure 1 illustrates one level of game
tree. The distance d, which has been shown in Figure 1, can be found by using
simple Pythagoras theorem, thus resulting in d =
√
∆l2 + 1.
Fig. 1. Illustration of one level of game tree [10]
Assuming that the approximate value of horizontal difference between nodes
is B
2
, then we can make a substitution and get d =
q
(
B
2
)
2 + 1. Here B stands
for the average branching factor of a game tree. The game progress for one game
is the total level of game tree times d. For the meantime, we do not consider
∆t2 because the value (∆t2 = 1) is assumed to be much smaller compared to
B. The game length will be normalized by the average game length D, then the
game progress x(t) is given by x(t) = t
D
· d =
t
D
q
(
B
2
)
2 =
Bt
2D
. Then, in general
we have Eq. (5).
x(t) = c
B
D
t (5)
where c is a different constant which depends on the game considered. However,
we manage to explain how to obtain the game information progress value itself.
The game progress in the domain of boardgames forms a linear graph with the
maximum value x(t) of B. Assuming 1
c = 1, then we have a realistic game
progress model for boardgames, which is given by
x(t) = B(
t
D
)
n
. (6)
We show, in Table 1, measures of game refinement for various games [11, 12,
13]. From the results, we conjecture the relation between the measure of game
refinement and game sophistication, as stated in Remark 1.
1
In this study we concern about this assumption.
Remark 1. Sophisticated games have a common factor (i.e., same degree of informatical acceleration value, say 0.07-0.08) to feel engaged or excited regardless
of different type of games.

3 Game Refinement Measure Revisited
It seems that the bridge between boardgame and continuous movement game
was successfully built. However, we claim that it is not yet completed. For this
purpose we detail the problem while considering the meaning of parameter c in
Eq. (5).
3.1 Possible Interpretations for Game Refinement Measure
For the sports games such as soccer, all the attempted shots or successful
shots (goals) are parts of the strategy to win the match, so they are an integral part of the game. In the domain of video games such as StarCraft II, the
branching factor was calculated only by reasonable strategies to be considered
as part of the winning [12]. This suggests that parameter c in Eq. (5) is a key
factor when considering the gap between boardgames and continuous movement
games. It also indicates that the parameter c can be replaced with p
n(n − 1)
in Eq. (4).
From Eq. (5) we obtain the measure of game refinement for boardgame as
shown in Eq. (7).
R =
√
cB
D
(
1
B
≤ c ≤ 1) (7)
Where we have cB = B when c = 1, and cB = 1 when c =
1
B
. Hence, the
assumption c = 1 means that we focus on a specific level of players or a certain
property of the game under consideration. When we focus on a certain level of
players like masters in boardgames, the crucial factor is the game property. If a
Fig. 2. A model of candidate move selection based on skill and chance [14]
game is skillful, the parameter c will decrease, whereas if the game is stochastic,
c will increase. This is because it is usually hard in such a stochastic game to
distinguish only fewer good candidates among all possible moves. On the other
hands, it would be possible in boardgames like chess for masters to identify a few
plausible moves. Note that continuous movement games such as sports games
are basically stochastic when compared with boardgames.
Remark 2. The parameter c = 1 in Eq. (5) means that the game under consideration is assumed to be insufficiently deterministic to identify plausible candidates.
We show from [14], in Figure 2, a model of move candidate selection based
on skill and chance. This illustration shows that skillful players would consider a
set (say b) of fewer plausible candidates among all possible moves (say B) to find
a move to play. For example, in chess where B = 35 and D = 80, when assuming
c = 1, then R = 0.074. On the other hands, as suggested in [15] [14], masters
in sophisticated boardgames would consider a very few moves on average in
their look-ahead thinking framework. An estimation of the number of plausible
candidates as a function of the strength of players (say s) may be given by
Eq. (8) [3].
b = B
1
s (1 ≤ s ∈ N) (8)
Let us consider the sports case with consideration on such a parameter. Like
the boardgame case, we may have a parameter (say Cs), as shown in Eq. (9).
R = Cs
√
G
T
(9)
Here we suspect that Cs may depend on the skill of teams. For the analysis,
many data from soccer leagues with different ranking were collected. We show,
in Table 2, measures of game refinement for each soccer league together with
the average number of goals (G) and shots attempts (T) per game. Two typical
groups are compared. The first group is clearly stronger than the second groups.
England Premier League (EPL), Primera division de Liga (LIGA) and Serie
A in the first group are the higher ranking leagues, whereas Chinese Football
Association Super League (CSL) in the second group is the lower ranking league
[16]. We notice from the results in Table 2 that when two similar-level teams
play each other in their leagues R value is quite similar. Thus, we assume Cs = 1
in this study.
Table 2. Measures of game refinement for each league football match
G T R
EPL (2016) 2.84 25.6 0.066
LIGA(2016) 2.75 23.6 0.070
Serie A (2016) 2.77 25.4 0.065
CSL (2014) 2.75 24.6 0.067
CSL (2015) 2.80 24.6 0.068
CSL (2016) 2.67 24.6 0.066
We show, in Figure 3, the relationship between the parameter c and chanceand-skill aspect. Note that we assume the estimation of the plausible candidates
as described in Eq. (8). From Figure 3 we conjecture that the parameter c relates
Fig. 3. The parameter c and chance-and-skill aspect of games
to the strength of players or the difficulty of a game, as stated in Remark 3.
Remark 3. The value of parameter c should be lower in the case where the game
under consideration is simple to identify fewer plausible candidates or the case
where players are very skillful like grandmasters.
Using the estimation of plausible candidates as shown in Eq. (8), we obtain
game refinement measures as described in Table 3.
We here summarize the meaning of game refinement measure.
– In a game where its game refinement measure is higher than the zone value
(0.07-0.08), people may feel more entertaining. This is because the game is
too stochastic or players are too weak to identify fewer plausible candidates.
Table 3. Measures of game refinement for boardgames with different parameters
R (c = 1) R (cB = b, s = 2)
Chess 0.074 0.030
Shogi 0.078 0.026
Go 0.076 0.019
– The game with a zone value of game refinement measure has a good balance
between chance and skill, in which people may feel comfortable and then the
game is sophisticated or fascinating.
– In a game where its game refinement measure is smaller than the zone value,
people may feel less entertaining. This is because the game is too simple or
players are too strong to experience harmonic uncertainty during the game
playing. In this situation the game tends to be competitive [17].
3.2 Relative Game Refinement Measure
The game refinement theory is basically used to evaluate the property (sophistication) of games with a focus on the game outcome uncertainty. Let us
consider the individual match analysis using game refinement measure [18] [19].
Since each match has an independent game process, game refinement measure
can be applied.
We demonstrate an analysis of two extreme conditions and special cases. The
first example is The 2014 World Cup semi-final [20]: Germany vs. Brazil, where
the number of goals G = 8 and the number of shot attempts T = 31. When
focusing on this match, R value is given by Eq. (10).
R =
√
G
T
=
√
8
31
= 0.091 (10)
In fact, this match was not a well balanced. Brazil had 1 goal, whereas Germany
had 7 goals. Individually, game refinement measure for Brazil (say RB) and
Brazil (say RG) is given in Eq. (11) and Eq. (12), respectively.
RB =
√
1
31
= 0.032 (11)
RG =
√
7
31
= 0.085 (12)
Apparently, the R value of Germany is higher than Brazil, which means that
Germany had better playing skill. Even more we need to know the psychological
meaning of game refinement value for each team’s perception. Then the relative
game refinement measure for Brazil (say Rr) is given by Eq. (13).
Rr = R ×
RB
RG
= 0.091 ×
0.032
0.085
= 0.034 (13)
Similarly, the relative game refinement measure for Germany is given by Eq. (14).
Rr = R ×
RG
RB
= 0.091 ×
0.085
0.032
= 0.242 (14)
From Eq. (13) and Eq. (14) we see that from Germany’s perspective, people
can enjoy the game for fun. Meanwhile from Brazil’s perspective, people may feel
very tough and they must seriously face the game progress. Larger R value means
higher fun, whereas smaller R value means more serious or competitiveness.
Illustration in Figure 4 shows the relation between R value and balance between
skill and chance in boardgames as well as continuous movement games.
Fig. 4. An illustration of the meaning of game refinement measure
3.3 Analysis of MOBA Games
Multi-player On-line Battle Arena (MOBA) [21] is the most popular game
type, in which a player controls a single character at one of two teams. MOBA
game is a typical continuous movement game. The objective is to destroy the
opponent team’s main structure with the assistance of periodically spawned computer controlled units. Player characters typically have various abilities and advantages that improve over the course of a game and that contribute to a team’s
overall strategy. Mainly in the world market, it was followed by three spiritual
successors: “League of Legends” (LOL), “Defense of the Ancients” (DotA) and
“Heroes of the Storm” (HotS) [22].
The game progress model of MOBA is given by the average number of successful killing heroes and destroying fortress (say K) over the average number of
attempts per game (say A) [13]. Hence, the game refinement measure of MOBA
is given by Eq. (15).
R =
√
K
A
(15)
The measures of game refinement for various MOBA games are shown in Table 4.
Because of the game battle system and macro mechanism, in DotA and LOL
one tower equals to 1 kill, and in HotS one castle equals to 4 kills [22]. For
killing tendency A, any tower or castle as 1 attempt is calculated. It is found
that R-value of sophisticated games is located somewhere between 0.07 to 0.08
[2] [10]. Distinctly, we notice that the game refinement value in LOL battle is so
high. It means that LOL will be too excited with high entertainment and low
competitiveness.

Version 6.80 68.6 106.2 0.078
LOL Version 6.6 37.65 44.26 0.138
Below we summarize the entertaining and competitiveness aspect of MOBA
games based on the game refinement values.
DotA: DotA is a very stable game, also it is a typical “G-T Model” (continuous movement games), for each version R-values are all seated between 0.07
to 0.08. Therefore, DotA is a well designed game with a good balance between
entertainment and competitiveness, which is suited for competitions. For the activity population, DotA2 has 7.9 million per month all over the world [23]. The
measure of game refinement indicates that DotA is the most successful and well
balanced MOBA game in the world.
LOL: Generally, R-value in LOL is too high, whereas DotA is almost in the
window value. It means that DotA fits for setting as e-sports competition, but
LOL is suited to enjoy for entertainment. DotA has powerful skill and more visual
impact for each hero, which cares more about management and running. Players
need to make a stable and safe environment to carry and develop. Gank usually
happens during the whole game. Generally, a DotA game may spend about 50
minutes but LOL usually takes around 30 minutes. LOL provides players with
a new style of MOBA game that spends less time for each game and forms a
fast rhythm. For the activity population, LOL has 67 million per month all over
the world [23]. The rhythm of LOL is faster and its game refinement is higher
than others. This implies that LOL is able to attract more children, female or
beginners who prefer to play it because of the higher entertainment property [1].
HotS: For HotS, the most important point is large-scale team combat and the
game rhythm is much higher than DotA or LOL. As a new game, HotS still
has some insufficient aspects. According to Table 4, the most interesting and
exciting map is ‘Sky temple’. ‘Battlefield of eternity’ and ‘Cursed hollow’ have
the highest level competitiveness. However, the game refinement measures of
HotS are higher than 0.08, which means that compared with DotA, HotS is not
so suitable for e-sports competition. Also some serious mechanism issue existed
in HotS, DotA focuses on the ana-phase period during the game, but the core
mechanism in HotS is wild monster. For this reason, the game depth of HotS
is less than DotA and gets a larger R-value. Therefore, HotS cares more about
teamwork than personal operation and game awareness, then we can only find
valid data about the population of HotS in US server is 0.13 million, the expected
number all over the world will not be larger than DotA2. Nevertheless, the fun
of HotS is not derived only from the battle. The various heroes and their talents
can provide a lot of enjoyment for Blizzard fans. In addition, they can design
maps which become more interesting and well balanced. Also the design group
of HotS needs to revise the game mechanism.
All property of these three MOBA games can be shown as Figure 5.

4 Concluding Remarks
The notion of game progress and game information progress model for continuous movement games was introduced in the development of game refinement
measure. It seemed to be a successful bridge between continuous movement
games like sports and boardgames. However, this paper claimed with a focus
on the parameter c in the game progress model for boardgames.
The parameter c relates to the game balance. The condition c = 1 corresponds to the case where the game is more chance-based one. If the parameter c
becomes lower, the game will be more skill-based one. Moreover, a new perspective of game refinement measure was obtained. Higher (lower) R value means
more entertaining (competitive), whereas 0.07-0.08 should be a comfortable zone
due to its good balance between skill and chance in game playing. The analysis
of popular MOBA games using game refinement measure supports the observation. The concept of relative game refinement measure was proposed to focus
on individual team performance in two team sports such as soccer. The game
refinement measure has been used to quantify the game sophistication for the
game under consideration. However, we considered the possibility of quantifying
the game sophistication from the viewpoint of individual team.
